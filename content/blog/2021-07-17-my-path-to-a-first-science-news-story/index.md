My first proper science story just ran in *Science News*, and with another paying gig for *Eos* lined up I'm starting to finally feel like a real science writer. A baby science writer, yes, but a real one. At least real enough to start introducing myself as "a graduate student and science writer" in emails to sources asking for interviews. 

Two months ago, I was just starting to toy with the idea of science writing and had no idea where to begin. Everything was confusing and the barrier to entry seemed insurmountably high. And after chatting with friends and colleagues -- and, later, getting involved with online science writing communities -- it seems like that feeling isn't unusual. Science writing, like science, comes with its own jargon and unspoken rules that can make the whole enterprise seem unapproachable and opaque to anyone who's not already in it.

But after a bit of giudance from an amazing mentor (and you can get one, too), I found that science writing isn't some dark art that only the enlightened few can master. It's basically just sending emails. So I thought it might be helpful to pause here at this first major science writing milestone to break down exactly how I got to this point -- specifically, how I was able to successfuly place a story for the first time. 

Of course, this is just one story. There are lots of ways to get started. But if you're looking for an example of how somethign like this *can* look, I hope this helps.

## I had relevant (non-professional) background experience with writing and science communciaiton

My piece for Science News is not the first writing I've produced for a public readership, and my experience definitely helped me get started with science writing faster than I would have otherwise.

I devoted a lot of time to campus publications as an undergrad. I lead the [yearbook](https://bigt.caltech.edu) at my university for three years, which involved writing and/or editing literally hundreds of articles and blurbs in addition to everything else that goes into a yearbook. I also wrote a piece for [The Caltech Letters](https://caltechletters.org) and served on its editorial board as a graphics editor, contributed a few pieces to the [student newspaper](https://campuspubs.library.caltech.edu/3323/1/TheCaliforniaTech_issue28.pdf), and took a part-time internship at the university communications office writing press releases about recent studies out of labs on campus. As a senior, I aslo took two classes relevant to science writing: one on journalism, and one about communicating science to the public.

And though not exactly science writing, I did also accrue a fair bit of experience with science communication and education. I wrote a good amount of curriculum for the 7 courses I TA'd, and would occasionally sit on panels at public Q&As about astrobiology. My friend Mike also started up a fantastic science podcast ([Strange New Worlds: A Science and Star Trek Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/strange-new-worlds-a-science-star-trek-podcast/id1246395860)) during my junior year, and I co-hosted the show with him for 1 year. 

During my gap year and after starting at MIT, I didn't do much science writing at all. But about 3 months ago, I started writing a few short (~350-word) "Lab Notes" for a site called [Massive Science](https://massivesci.com). I wrote [my Lab Notes](https://massivesci.com/people/elise-cutts/) summarizing recent research articles in geology and microbiology. You can also write longer (~800 words) stories for Massive, but it's a more intensive process -- and the editing is slow. I've had an article in edits with them for over a month now, which isn't unusual for Massive but is very unusual for journalism at large. 

I mention this because I want to be honest about my own path, not because I think it's necessarily important that you spend years working on student publications, science blogging, or otherwise writing for free before you start sending off pitches. If you're confident and enthusiastic (and can handle rejection), go ahead and pitch! But if you'd rather develop your writing skills a bit and build a small portfolio before you jump into freelance writing, there are lot of options for you to do that. 

## My first clips came from student publications, my blog, my university communications office, and Massive Science

If you've been reading about how to publish science writing, you've probably run into the idea of a "clip." Clips are just pieces of published writing that you can show an editor to convince them that you can write. When you "pitch," or email editors with story ideas to ask for work, you'll include clips to show off your writing skills. Unlike a lot of fields, writing really does seem to be the kind of industry in which your skill matters more than your credentials -- it doesn't matter what you studied or what your work history looks like. If you can prove that you can write, you can write. 

Great, but if you don't have clips, how do you even get in the door? Isn't it a chicken-and-egg problem?

Yes and no. You probably won't land a first gig writing for the NYT science section without any clips (although I suppose anything is possible with an irresistable, well-crafted pitch). But you can definitely get published without experience, especially if you're willing to work for free -- although you should only need to do that at first, and probably not for as long as you think you'll have to. 

I got my first clips writing for student publications, blogging (sporadically), and working for Caltech's communciations office writing press releases as an intern. That internship was the kind of job that didn't exist until I asked about it, and if you're a student, odds are that you might be able to find some similar opportunities if you look for or ask about them at your own university. Comms people are nice, in my experience. So don't be shy. I wasn't paid for anything I wrote for the student publications or my blog, and I earned a low set salary as an intern. 

My most recent clips came from Massive. I wrote 4 Lab Notes for them over about a month and a half. Massive trains scientists to write about science through their discussion board (called the Consortium), which you can join for $15. Publishing Lab Notes nets you $20 a pop, so it's a net gain so long as you publish *something*. Lab Notes are a great way to get early clips because the barrier to entry is low -- you don't need to interview anyone to write them, the pitch process is straightforward (it's just a Google Form), and the Massive editors don't expect you to have writing experience. I used my Massive clips to show that I could structure news pieces and write in a news voice, even if the stories weren't reported (i.e. didn't involve interviews) and were about half the length of a typical science news article. Massive doesn't pay nearly enough to make it worth writing for them as an established freelancer (a rate closer to $300 for a Lab Note would be in the ballpark), but it's a good ego-boost for newbies to get paid at all, and most of Massive's writers are professional scientists who get a proper salary and health insurance through their day jobs. 

So, by the time I pitched Science News, I had plenty of clips from institutional and student publications, as well as my blog posts. Those aren't fantastic portfolio pieces for science journalism, but they are far better than nothing. And I've bene told that having clips in more than one publication likely helped, as well. 

## I read up on science writing, reluctantly joined Twitter, and sent off a few (rejected) pitches

Shortly before I started writing for Massive, I startd to read up on science writing and started to more actively search for opportunities to get involved. I also joined Twitter.

You can survive in science writing without Twitter, but if you want to do this at least semi-professionally, you'll probably need to make an account at some point --- and you'll definitely need to understand how the platform works, at least a little, since publications often ask you to write tweets they'll use to showcase your writing. When used well and in moderation, Twitter can be a great place to connect with other science writers and editors, to find resources, get answers to questions you didn't have about the industry, and follow the careers of people you'd like to emulate. It's also a sort of digital calling card for journalists. But it can also be a depressing time-sink. 

I limit my Twitter usage to 15 minutes a day using an app timer, and that works well for me. I've seen lots of more senior science writers use Twitter pretty much exclusively to post their new articles. My mentor does this, and she's doing just fine without spending a lot of time tweeting. You get to decide how you relate to the platform. Just know that you'll probably be forced onto it eventually. 

I mention Twitter here not only because it is inevitable but also because I have Twitter to thank for making me aware of opportunities and resources that made a big difference for me. Researcher and science journalist [Shi En Kim](https://twitter.com/goes_by_kim) is a friend of a friend of mine, and I followed her on Twitter knowing that she'd managed to do something a lot like what I'd like to pull off -- pivoting from science into science-and-science-writing. After winning the [AAAS Mass Media Fellowship](https://www.aaas.org/programs/mass-media-fellowship), which is basically the holy grail of the science-science-writing pivot, she posted a thread outlining the resources that had helped her develop as a science writer. 

Kim's tweets directed me to Massive, the [National Association of Science Writers](https://www.nasw.org) (NASW), the [NPR Scicommers](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/537735624/friends-of-joes-big-idea-fojbis) program, [The Open Notebook](https://www.theopennotebook.com), and more resources I just haven't had the chance to take advantage of yet. She also mentioned the names of other science writers and editors, who I followed and whose feeds continue to provide me with useful information.

The Open Notebook (TON) is an amazing resource for anyone who wants to learn about science writing, with hundreds of articles that pull back the curtain on the industry. One of the TON articles I read lead me to scientist-turned-journalist [Wudan Yan](https://twitter.com/wudanyan)'s writing, which lead me to her [podcast](https://www.thewriterscooppod.com), which has also been a great help.

Inspired by what I was reading on TON and elsewhere, I started putting some pitches together and sent them off to random places. I sent one to [Inverse](https://www.inverse.com/science), a publication I had found through a Massive editor I follow on Twitter, and one to [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/pages/article/how-to-write-for-nat-geo), just because. Both were rejected! But Massive kept taking my Lab Notes.

## I joined NASW and found a mentor through the Perlman Summer Mentorship Program

The single most important decision I made related to science writing was joining NASW. For students, it's only $20 to join and the value is fantastic. NASW offers networking opportunities, hosts an annual conference for science writers, and has lots of resources, fellowships, and other support for science writers at every stage of their careers. 

NASW started the Perlman Virtual Mentorship Program in 2020 as a way to compensate for lost opportunities in the first summer of COVID. But it's amazing, COVID or no COVID, and I really hope that they decide to keep it around afterwards.

Student members sign up and are paired with volunteer NASW members who mentor them over the summer. There's a bit of matchmaking to it, and you're asked about your interests and what kind of mentor you'd prefer (a freelancer, a staff writer, etc.). I was paied with the incredible Katherine Kornei, who I realized after meeting her had written about half of the science news stories I'd recently read (she covers earth science, space, and biology).

Being able to ask Kathy questions was amazing, and she helped me learn the subtler things about science journalism that I hadn't been able to glean from reading about it. Like how to address editors and sources in emails, how often to send reminders about pitches, how old stories can be before they're not fresh anymore, where to look for interesting science stories, how much pay is reasonable, etc. etc. She read my emails to help me feel less scared the first time I sent them off, and she helped me revise stories once I got assignments.

I can't understate how important finding a mentor was for me. If there's any chance you can find a mentor, take it. Join whatver programs you can to get one. Just get one. It'll make all the difference.

## With help from my mentor, I made my first successful pitch

Kathy told me that a good way to find a science story is to pick a few journals (preferably obscure ones, staffers and pro freelancers will beat you to anything from Science or Nature) to follow and look for interesting papers as they came out. I did just that, and found a few papers I liked. With Kathy's help, I picked one to write about for the Perlman program project, and one to pitch directly to publications.

I wrote a pitch by basically copying what I saw on [TON's Pitch Database](https://www.theopennotebook.com/pitch-database/). I originally sent the pitch to an editor at *Eos*, but it was rejected, apparently because the paper I'd chosen is from an AGU journal and *Eos*, an AGU publication, leaves coverage of AGU journals to the comms department. So Kathy suggested I send the pitch to Science News, and found an editor contact for me by asking around among her colleagues. It's apparently common practice for journalists to trade editor contact information among themselves.

It's generally best if you email an editor directly. Even if you email the wrong person (which I actually did end up doing with Science News!), editors can pass your emails along to the person who should really see them.

To my great shock and giddy joy, Science News took the pitch. 

## The next pitch was easier
