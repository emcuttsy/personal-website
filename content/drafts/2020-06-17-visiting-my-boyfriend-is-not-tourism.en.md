Before the pandemic, I was living and working in Denmark as part of the Fulbright exchange program. I had arrived in September, and with a residence permit valid through July, the plan was to stay in Europe until returning to the US to start my PhD in the fall. 

The plan wasn't to fall in love. But plans change.

Clemens is handsome and warm-hearted, incredibly hardworking, a talented rock climber, thoughtful, curious, loving hover-dad to a very spoiled dog, and---infuriatingly---much funnier than me even speaking my native English as a foreign language. He was finishing up his PhD in the same department I worked in during my Fulbright, and we quickly became close friends. In time (and despite our best efforts to avoid getting tangled up in a long-distance relationship) we ended up becoming more. I've never met someone who made me feel so loved and so at home.  

But now that feeling of home is locked behind closed borders. His Austrian passport can't get him into the US under the current restrictions, and I can't get to him, either: Austria's external borders have stayed shut and Denmark, where he stayed to take a postdoctoral research position, remains mostly closed even to Europeans---Americans can forget about it. 

To top things off, since I followed the rules and registered my departure with the Danish authorities, my Danish residence permit was voided. 

Back in March, we still were hopeful that I could fly back in June to help him move into his new apartment in Odense and then spend the summer together. But the travel restrictions kept getting extended. And even now, as things begin to return to normal within the EU and Schengen zone, any possibility that we will be able to reunite before I begin my PhD in the fall is withering away to something less than the shadow of a hope.
