![](./me_geologisthat.jpg#centerXtraPadding)

I'm an incoming PhD student at MIT studying geobiology. My scientific interests are broadly in the ongoing and historical interractions between life and the Earth, especially when it comes to microbial life and environmental conditions.

Before MIT, I earned my B.S. in geobiology at Caltech and spent a Fulbright involved in geobiological research at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, Denmark before the pandemic terminated my exchange. After having spent a few months in the US, I'm now back in Denmark---this time just to see my boyfriend before I head off to Cambridge in the fall. 

I write about my experiences navigating science and graduate school as n√§ive newcomer to the ivory tower. The blog is usually updated monthly with a new opinion piece and weekly with regular content.

## Research

I'm interested in life, the planet, and how the two interract with one another. When I get started at MIT, I'll be joining the [Bosak Group](http://bosaklab.scripts.mit.edu/) to study the clumped isotope record of dolomite. I also plan to work on a collaborative project with the Fournier Group performing phylogenomic analysis of metagenomes derived from pustular microbial mats in Shark Bay, Australia.

### Previous Research
As a Fulbrighter at the University of Southern Denmark, I cultured marine cyanobacteria under a range of oxygen partial pressures to determine the effect of oxygen on carbon isotope fractionation by cyanobacterial photosynthesis. Unfortunately, this project was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

At Caltech, I worked with Prof. Victoria Orphan to isolate members of a chitin-degrading microbial community sampled from a whalefall site. I also worked with Prof. Bethany Ehlmann to adapt imaging spectroscopy techniques for mineralogical analysis of Martian meteorites and with Dr. Steven Vance at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on modeling the carbonate chemistry of Europa's ocean. 

See [my CV](../cv/) for more.

Thanks for visiting!
