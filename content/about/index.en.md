![](./me_geologisthat.jpg#centerXtraPadding)

I'm a first-year geobiology PhD student at MIT in the [Bosak Group](http://bosaklab.scripts.mit.edu/). My scientific interests are broadly in the ongoing and historical interactions between life and the Earth, especially when it comes to microbial life and Earth's surface environmental conditions.

Before MIT, I studied geobiology at Caltech and spent a Fulbright involved in geobiological research at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, Denmark.

Thanks for visiting!
