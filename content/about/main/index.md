  I'm Elise, a US American science writer living in beautiful Graz, Austria.

  My core beat is physics and geoscience, but I also love writing about math and language whenever I can convince an editor to let me. I've written for *Scientific American*, *Discover*, *Science News*, AGU's *Eos*, *Sky & Telescope*, and more. 

  Before I was a science writer, I was a geomicrobiologist at MIT, where I studied how bacteria snot turns into rock. I jumped into writing with a AAAS Mass Media Fellowship at Voice of America. When I'm not hunting down researcher emails or re-re-re-writing a lede, I'm probably either getting lost in some forest, trying to learn a real language, or making up a fake one.
