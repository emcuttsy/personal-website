  Like many science writers, I was a scientist before I figured out that doing science is (for me) substantially less fun than writing about it. 
  
  In 2019, I earned my M.S. in Earth Science at MIT, where I studied how bacteria snot transforms into rock. I then jumped into writing with a AAAS Mass Media Fellowship at *Voice of America*. Before that, I earned my B.S. in Geobiology at Caltech and spent a Fulbright at the University of Southern Denmark in 2020. 

  My core beat is now physics and geoscience, but I also love writing about my pet topics, language and birds, whenever I can convince an editor to let me. I've written for *National Geographic*, *Quanta*, *Scientific American*, *Discover*, *Science News*, *Eos*, *Sky & Telescope*, and more. 
  
  When I'm not hunting down researcher emails or re-re-re-writing a lede, I'm probably either trying to learn a real language or making up a fake one.

  I speak English and German and am happy to correspond in either language // *Ich spreche Englisch und Deutsch und korrespondiere gern in beiden Sprachen.*
