  When I'm not in the lab, I'm often writing about science. I have words in *Massive Science*, *Caltech News*, *The California Tech*, *Caltech Magazine*, *The Big T*, and *Caltech Letters*, and am actively looking to freelance for more outlets.

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
