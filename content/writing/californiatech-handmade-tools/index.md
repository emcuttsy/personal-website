excerpt: "Rick Gerhart, a short, smiling man with a voice like the breathy rumble of a gasoline engine, numbers among the shrinking handful of master glassblowers in
Los Angeles. He is 73 years old. And
when he retires in September, Gerhart
will leave the shop – and his legacy –
to his apprentice, 28-year-old Nathan
Hart."
