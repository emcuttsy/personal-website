"If you had asked me before covid," she answered thoughfully, "I probably would have thought differently"

This acute sense of the uncertainty of the future is something I encounter a lot in other young people. For every reason outlined in every discussion of millenials and gen Z ever written, we cannot believe in a better future like our parents did.

My mom told me that telling me to prioritize the future seems almost absurd now, when the future is so uncertain. She worries about climate change and future pandemics, and watching the world over the past decade or so she struggles to feel confident that things will be stable for me like they were for her.

And even if they were, she said, none of us make it out of this thing alive anyways.

So instead of counseling me to do the safe thing, she wants me to do what will make me happy now—not later—now. Later is a bet, now is a certainty. And I'm fortunate enough that, even if I make a few mistakes, I probably won't end up falling irrevocably far.

Reminded me of the Kurzgesagt video about "Optimistic Nihilism" — a term I haven't heard anywhere that wasn't Kurzgesagt or 

Lack any real inherit importance.The Absurd = search for answers in an answerless world. T

The world doesn't exist for a reason. No absolutes to abide by, no cosmic justice fairness, no rules. 

Terrifying abundance of freedom. Sartre thought that we were painfully shockingly free. Each of us forced to design out own moral code. "Condemned to be free" All of the authorities are fake. All authorities are really just people like you. 

The best thing you can really do is to live authentically. Accept your freedom in lifght of the absurd. Any meaning is what you decide. If you accept the path other people lays out, you act in bad faith. Bad faith = refusal to accept the absurd. 

The literal meaning of life is whatever you're doing that prevents you from killing yourself (camus)

If the world is devoid of purpose then it CAN have purpose, only the purpose you give it.
