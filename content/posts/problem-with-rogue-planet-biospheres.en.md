Intro: blahblahblah rogue planets

Kurzgesagt, one of my favorite Youtube science channels, [has a beautiful video about them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7CkdB5z9PY) and the possibility of "life under the ice."

The video specifically points to a type of hydrothermal vent called a "black smoker." Black smokers are essentially underwater volcanic hot springs. Seawater percolates down through the ocean floor, where it is heated and chemically altered by magma before rising to the surface. The iconic chimney structures and black "smoke" are actually made of iron sulfide minerals that precipitate as vent fluids come into contact with seawater. There are other kinds of vents as well, including white smokers and alkaline hydrothermal vents. 

There are a lot of misconceptions when it comes to hydrothermal vents. I think that we like to think of them as these sort of magical oases on the desert ocean floor where the normal rules about what it takes to run an ecosystem break down. 

The problem is, black smokers woulnd't be possible on a rogue planet. At
