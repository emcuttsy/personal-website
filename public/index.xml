    <description><![CDATA[<p>Something I&rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed in the first few weeks of taking a phylogenomics course is getting to think about non-microbial life for a change. The class will reorient its focus in a microbial direction here in the upcoming weeks, but thinking about familiar groups of macroscopic organisms to start makes it a lot easier to get a grip on fundamental concepts in phylogenomics and evolution.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb here and guess that most scientists didn&rsquo;t decide to become reseachers because they dreamed of pouring hours into Matlab scripts and peering at liness of code on a computer screen.</p>]]></description>
