    <description><![CDATA[<p>Oxygen is one of those things that nobody thinks about unless they either don&rsquo;t have it or they&rsquo;re a scientist. Either way, once you <em>do</em> start to think about oxygen, its usually not long until you start thinking there&rsquo;s nothing more important in the universe.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>After finishing Duolingo German, I started making digital flashcards so that I&rsquo;d have something to keep my iThumbs occupied through corona lockdown better than scrolling through the reams of international and domestic horrors served up by my newsfeed. I ended up spending months of experimenting with Anki and looking into popular German vocabulary sets online, and <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1877324510" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this 1000-word flashcard deck of core German vocabulary</a>  is the result.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Something I&rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed in the first few weeks of taking a phylogenomics course is getting to think about non-microbial life for a change. The class will reorient its focus in a microbial direction here in the upcoming weeks, but thinking about familiar groups of macroscopic organisms to start makes it a lot easier to get a grip on fundamental concepts in phylogenomics and evolution.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Coming to Boston was definitely easier than going to Denmark this summer—at least there wasn&rsquo;t a risk of being turned away at the border—but it also wasn&rsquo;t exactly <em>easy</em>. Cancelled flights, state travel rules, booked-up COVID-19 test centers, and layer upon layer of MIT pandemic policy made it all a bit more complicated than I anticipated.</p>
<p>And on top of all that, my mattress won&rsquo;t be here for another week! They said 3-5 days 14 days ago!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb here and guess that most scientists didn&rsquo;t decide to become reseachers because they dreamed of pouring hours into Matlab scripts and peering at liness of code on a computer screen.</p>]]></description>
