I'm a first-year geobiology PhD student at MIT in the [Bosak Group](http://bosaklab.scripts.mit.edu/). My scientific interests are broadly in the ongoing and historical interactions between life and the Earth, especially when it comes to microbial life and Earth's surface environmental conditions. Right now, I'm using metagenomics to study the microbial community of Shark Bay microbial mats. 

Since I do science all day, I mainly post about other things, like watching the US election unfold from my boyfriend's couch in Denmark and tips for persuading anki flashcards to do conditional formatting. I also tend to post regularly about learning German since that's what I spend most of my free time on these days.

Before MIT, I studied geobiology at Caltech and spent a Fulbright involved in geobiological research at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense.
