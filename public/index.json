[{"categories":"Science Writing","content":"I suspect that there are plenty of other researchers out there who are at least toying with the idea that writing about science might be more fun than actually doing it. But how to start?\nBreaking into science writing without media experience is intimidating, but it is possible. My first reported science story ran this week in Science News, and seeing as the obligatory rounds of self-promotional texts have been sent and the celebratory tea poured, now feels like a good time to pause and reflect. This post walks through everything that went into getting my first pitch accepted, from my background to specififc resources and programs that helped me.\nThere are many paths into science writing, and mine is just one. But I hope that seeing how getting a first pitch accepted can work in practice might inspire others thinking of taking the same leap.\nI built confidence through science communication and student publications     I have a few years of relevant writing experience through science communication and student publications. So while pitching my piece to Science News was nervewracking, I could trust that I\u0026rsquo;d be able to get the job done if given a chance.\nScience journalism and science communication aren\u0026rsquo;t the same thing, but they do have a substantial degree of overlap. And since there are so many ways for scientists to get involved, science communication often a relatively easy place for researchers to build skill and confidence as writers and communciators. As an undergrad, I took a part-time internship at the university communications department writing news blurbs and press releases,and it was fantastic experience\u0026ndash;I got to interview scientists, learn about the media cycle, and write, write, write. I also TA\u0026rsquo;d a lot of courses and co-hosted a friend\u0026rsquo;s science podcast for a year, both of which built up communication skills that transfer well to science writing.\nLikewise, student publications often have a pretty low barrier to entry. So if you\u0026rsquo;re a student or university affiliate looking to start writing about science, they can be a great place to start. I was the editor-in-chief of my university yearbook as an undergrad and wrote a few times for the school paper.\nI mention this because I want to be honest about my own path, not because I think it\u0026rsquo;s necessarily important that you spend years working on student publications, interning, podcasting, or anything else before you start sending off pitches. If you feel ready, then by all means go ahead and pitch!\nI built a portfolio of non-journalism clips     First clips are a classic chicken-and-egg problem: you need clips to convince editors to take your pitch, but you can\u0026rsquo;t convince those editors to take your pitch without clips. Clearly, this is impossible.\nYes and no. You probably won\u0026rsquo;t land a first gig writing for the NYT science section without any clips (although I suppose anything is possible with an irresistable, well-crafted pitch). But you can definitely get published without experience, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to work for free \u0026ndash; although you should only need to do that at first, and probably not for as long as you think you\u0026rsquo;ll have to.\nI got my first clips writing for my university\u0026rsquo;s press office as an intern, for student publications like the yearbook, school newspaper, and grad student science blogs, my personal blog, and most recently for Massive Science. Massive is somewhere between science communicaiton and science journalism and is written mostly by scientist-scicommers. I wrote a handful of ~350 word Lab Notes summarizing recent research articles in geology and microbiology. Lab Notes are quick and the editors don\u0026rsquo;t expect you to have writing experience, so theyr\u0026rsquo;e a good place to start.\nSo, by the time I pitched Science News, I had plenty of non-journalism clips to show my editor. Things like this aren\u0026rsquo;t fantastic portfolio pieces for science journalism, but they are far better than nothing. A scicomm-savvy friend tells me that having clips in more than one outlet likely helped, as well.\nI read up on science writing and freelancing, joined Twitter, and sent off a few (rejected) pitches     These next steps are a bit more nebulous, because they were basically just information gathering.\nI started looking into science writing more seriously about the same time I started writing for Massive, and that lead me to Twitter. You can survive in science writing without Twitter, but it is undeniably useful and you\u0026rsquo;ll be expected to have one. When used well and in moderation, Twitter can be a great place to connect with other science writers and editors, find resources, get answers to questions you didn\u0026rsquo;t know you should have, and follow the careers of people you\u0026rsquo;d like to emulate. It\u0026rsquo;s also a sort of digital calling card for journalists.\nTwitter lead me to some amazing resources. I followed researcher and science journalist Shi En Kim knowing that she\u0026rsquo;d managed to do something a lot like what I\u0026rsquo;d like to pull off \u0026ndash; pivoting from science into science-and-science-writing. After winning the AAAS Mass Media Fellowship, which is basically the holy grail of the science-science-writing pivot, she posted a thread outlining the things that had helped her develop as a science writer.\nKim\u0026rsquo;s tweets directed me to Massive, the National Association of Science Writers (NASW), the NPR Scicommers program, The Open Notebook (TON), and more resources I just haven\u0026rsquo;t had the chance to take advantage of yet. She also mentioned the names of other science writers and editors, who I followed and whose feeds continue to provide me with useful information. Somewhere between reading TON articles and searching for additional information elsewhere, I stumbled onto scientist-turned-journalist Wudan Yan\u0026rsquo;s writing and to her podcast, which has also been a great help.\nEventually, I started putting some pitches together. I sent one to Inverse, a publication I had found through a Massive editor I follow on Twitter, and one to National Geographic, just because. Both were rejected! But Massive kept taking my Lab Notes.\nI joined NASW and found a mentor through the Perlman Virtual Mentorship Program     The single most important decision I made related to science writing was joining NASW. For students, it\u0026rsquo;s only $20 to join and the value is fantastic. NASW offers networking opportunities, hosts an annual conference for science writers, and has lots of resources, fellowships, and other support for science writers at every stage of their careers.\nAfter joining, I signed up for the Perlman Virtual Mentorship Program, a summer mentor-match program for student NASW members. I was paired with an amazing freelance science journalist who covers Earth and space science and bit of biology, and I started to work on a reporting project for the program that should run on the NASW Student Newsroom site in August. With my mentor\u0026rsquo;s help, I also started to put together pitchess for Science News and Eos.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t understate how important finding a mentor was for me. Being able to ask my mentor questions was especially helpful for learning the subtler things in science journalism \u0026mdash; like how to email editors and sources, what pitches look like, how old research can be before it isn\u0026rsquo;t not fresh anymore, where to look for interesting science stories, how much pay is reasonable, what publications like what kinds of stories, etc. etc. She read my emails to help me feel less scared the first time I sent them off, and she helped me revise stories once I got assignments.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s any chance you can find a mentor, take it. Join whatver programs you can to get one. Just get one. It\u0026rsquo;ll make all the difference.\nWith help from my mentor, I made my first successful pitch     My mentor told me that a good way to find a science story is to pick a few journals (preferably obscure ones, staffers and pro freelancers will beat you to anything from Science or Nature) to follow and look for interesting papers as they came out. I did just that, and found a few papers I liked. I picked one to write about for the Perlman program project, and one to pitch directly to publications.\nI wrote a pitch by basically copying what I saw on TON\u0026rsquo;s Pitch Database. I originally sent the pitch to an editor at Eos, but it was rejected. So my mentor suggested I send the pitch to Science News and she found an editor contact for me by asking around among her colleagues (trading editor contacts is apparently normal practice among journalists).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s generally best if you email an editor directly. Find a specific person to email. Even if you email the wrong person (which I actually did end up doing with Science News!), editors can pass your emails along to the person who should really see them.\nI sent off the pitch and, to my great shock and joy, Science News actually took it!\nThe boring but important stuff: they offered me a rate I was happy with and a contract that wasn\u0026rsquo;t exploitative, so I officially signed on to write the story. $650 for 500 words is better than I was expecting to start with, and my mentor says not to go below $0.75/word as a general rule. Even as a new freelancer, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take exploitatively low pay or sign a ridiculous contract. Negotiate with editors if something\u0026rsquo;s off \u0026mdash; I negotiated my second contract, and while I didn\u0026rsquo;t get what I asked for, I didn\u0026rsquo;t lose any standing with my editor, either. It\u0026rsquo;s just business. If you\u0026rsquo;re curious about the financial side of freelancing and what to look out for in contracts, I can\u0026rsquo;t recommend Wudan Yan and Jenni Gritters' freelance business podcast, The Writers Co-op, enough.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s that!\nRecap: you can do this     Whew. That\u0026rsquo;s probably more detail than anyone wanted or needed. But the point is to be transparent.\nI hope you got the sense that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t any master plan here. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t. Getting a mentor was the most important part for me, and I\u0026rsquo;d recommend finding someone to mentor you if you can. But if not, there\u0026rsquo;s no magic to it. My editor at Science News didn\u0026rsquo;t know my mentor, and she took my pitch based on what it said and the little portfolio I had, not because of backroom handshaking. If you build up a portfolio and write a good pitch (there\u0026rsquo;s a whole database of examples), you can definitely get published.\nYou might get rejected, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine. Pitch the story again somewhere else. I only pitched Science News after Eos rejected my first pitch. And pitch again to editors who don\u0026rsquo;t take you the first time\u0026mdash;Eos took me the second time.\n","href":"https://elisecutts.com/blog/2021-07-17-my-path-to-a-first-science-news-story/","title":"How I got my first science journalism clip"},{"categories":"Astrobiology","content":"The public origin of life debate sometimes feels like a parallel universe to the scientific one. And in many ways, it really is a parallel debate.—the big questions have almost nothing to do with one antoher and, more fundamentally, the battle raging beyond the ivory tower has more to do with faith than research. According to a 2019 Gallup poll, 40% of Americans believe that God created humans in their current form no more than about 10,000 years ago. And if that\u0026rsquo;s your view, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t much matter whether the person you\u0026rsquo;re debating thinks that life got started at a hydrothermal vent on the bottom of the ocean or in a warm little pond of primordial soup. That\u0026rsquo;s just not the point.\nGiven that the creationism debate tends to pit \u0026ldquo;science\u0026rdquo; vs \u0026ldquo;religion,\u0026rdquo; there isn\u0026rsquo;t usually much room (and often too much risk) to dig into the finer points of current scientific thought on life\u0026rsquo;s origins. Putting up a divided fron\u0026rsquo;t isn\u0026rsquo;t usually a great way to win an argument, and and given that evolution is one of the most important cornerstones of modern biology (including the ongoing research on COVID-19 that will eventually allow life to return to normal), it\u0026rsquo;s best not to mess around. It\u0026rsquo;s better to stick to the main line: Researchers almost unilaterally agree that all life evolved from a common ancestor, and that life must have emerged from non-life at least once at least 3.5 billion years ago.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s about where the agreement ends. And where the disagreement begins, so does the nastiness. Ask anyone with so much as a toe in the astrobiology waters and they\u0026rsquo;ll tell you that the origins debate is a can of worms best left unopened unless you\u0026rsquo;re writing a thesis in worm physiology.\nAnd interestingly, it\u0026rsquo;s not clear that there was a time in which that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case—even back before we could agree where worms actually come from.\nUp until the mid-19th century, the most important scientific question regarding the origin of life was that of spontaneous generation. Spontaneous generation was the belief that new living things regularly formed out of non-living material without descent from other living things. Small animals like insects and organisms like fungi, plants, and fish whose reproductive cycles either don\u0026rsquo;t look like ours or are hard to observe in particular were thought to arise this way. Leave food to rot and it will turn into flies and mice. Leave a pile of soil for a while and you\u0026rsquo;ll cook yourself up a fresh batch of worms.\nThat disproving this idea was a major step towards our current understanding of evolution and the common descent of life has something of an ironic aftertaste today considering that today\u0026rsquo;s origin of life debate hinges entirely on how such \u0026ldquo;spontaneous generation\u0026rdquo; might really have happened—how physics, chemistry, and geology could come together to produce biology. One should not be too hasty to throw today\u0026rsquo;s hypotheses into the same, sinking boat as spontaneous generation, however. Beyond the obvious distinctions to be drawn between modern research and the natural philosophy of bygone centuries, abiogenesis as we conceptualize it today and spontaneous generation are very different ideas. Spontaneous generation was considered to be a commonplace process necessary for replenishing populations of certain organisms, but researchers now tend to consider the origin of life to be a rare, potentially once-in-a-universe event requiring very specific circumstances unique to the early Earth—and which is definitely not how worms are made.\nThere are documented experiments on spontaneous generation dating back as far as the 16th century, and throughout the 18th century researchers produced a series of results that we today would probably accept as conclusive evidence that broth does not spontaneously transform into bacteria and that you can\u0026rsquo;t whip up a fresh batch of mice from soiled cloth and a bit of old grain. That the old doctrine would be tested during this time makes perfect sense when seen in the light of another doctrine—the Catholic church had espoused spontaneous generation throughout the Middle Ages but had made an about-face on the topic by 1668 when Francesco Redi performed his famous experimentst proving that maggots that appear on rotting meat arise not from the meat itself but rather from eggs laid by flies.\nRead a bit of the scientific discourse from this time and it becomes clear that acrimony in origin of life debates is more a case of common descent than spontaneous generation. Scottish entymologist James Rennie, for instance, devoted the entire first chapter of his 1838 book Insect Transformations to discussing and debunking the spontaneous generation of insects and wrote scathingly of some of his contemporaries who claimed to have observed spontaneous generation of microorganisms under the microscope:\n The experiments of Redi on the hatching of insects from Eggs, which were published in Florence in 1668, first brought discredit upon this doctrine [of spontaneous generation], though it had always a few eminent disciples. At present it is maintained by a considerable number of distinguished naturalists, such as Blumenbach, Cuvier, Bory de St. Vincent, R. Brown, etc. … It would be unprofitable to go into any lengthened discussion upon this mysterious subject; and we have great doubts whether the ocular demonstration by the microscope would succeed except in the hands of a disciple of the school. Even with naturalists, whose business it is to deal with facts, the reason is often wonderfully influenced by the imagination.\nRennie, 1838\n Still, spontaneous generation stuck around despite mounting evidence and a pinch of herecy, and remained popular in serious scientific circles by the mid-19th century. This was especially true in Germany among the Naturphilosophen—so naturally the inverse trend held in neighboring (and often enemy) France.\nIn the late 1850s, Louis Pasteur performed a series of experiments on spontaneous generation very similar to previous work by John Needham in 1745 and Lazzaro Spallanzani 1768. Spallanzani\u0026rsquo;s experiments, which were an elaboration on Needham\u0026rsquo;s, involved boiling broths in sealed flasks with the air inside partially removed to prevent explosions under heat. He observed that flasks prepared in this way would never spoil so long as they were left unopened, but that opened flasks spoiled quickly. Some rejected Spallanzani\u0026rsquo;s results claiming that air was necessary to transform the broth into new organisms, but by Pasteur\u0026rsquo;s time there was already a strong current of thought against spontaneous generation. By performing the Spallanzani experiments with swan-necked flasks, which allowed air to enter the flask but prevented microbes from reaching the broth, Pasteur was able to address that final objection.\nMore interestingly and only seldomly noted, Pasteur\u0026rsquo;s work with the swan-neck flasks was preceeded by a series of outrageous experiments in which he hauled sealed bottles of broth out to locations around Europe—including up to glaciers in the Alps—to test his hypothesis that there might be more germs in the air in some environments than in others. He also apparently bottled air from these places, took it back to his laboratory, and repeated the test there. As crazy as this sounds, it worked—we\u0026rsquo;re so used to thinking that germs are everywhere now that it almost seems absurd that there\u0026rsquo;d be fewer of them, say, on a mountaintop. But it\u0026rsquo;s true. Alpine air isn\u0026rsquo;t sterile of course, but there are fewer bacteria in places where there is less food to sustain them. So the flasks opened in fresh mountain air tended to spoil less often on average than those opened elsewhere. These results lended strong support to the idea that germs not only existed but that they could be unevenly distributed in space, ultimately leading to Pasteur\u0026rsquo;s realization that germs could be physically separated from air and culminating in the more famous swan-necked flask experiments.\nHowever, as neat and tidy as the Pasteur experiments may seem now—and how neatly and tidily the matter seems to have been settled according to every \u0026lsquo;history\u0026rsquo; info box in every biology textbook I\u0026rsquo;ve ever read—spontaneous generation did not go down without one last, nasty fight.\nFélix Archimède Pouchet, a prominent naturalist 22 years Pasteur\u0026rsquo;s senior, vigorously opposed the results. He even went so far as to run the swan-neck flask experiment himself, and claimed to have observed results that contradicted Pasteur\u0026rsquo;s. And according to Albert Keim\u0026rsquo;s 1914 biography of Pasteur, the conflict didn\u0026rsquo;t stay confined to academia for long, either.\n Both parties made experiments on their own behalf, and each experiment gave different results. These polemics spread beyond scientific circles to the daily press, and, since the question of religion was involved, the public took sides for one party or the other, according to their individual opinions…\nKeim, 1914\n Some analyses of the debate have also ascribed some of the antipathy towards spontaneous generation in France to its association with German academic and cultural currents. So the religious, political, and scientifc were very much intertwined, much as they are in today\u0026rsquo;s creationism vs. evolution debate.\nEven acknowledging the important social stakes of the Pasteur-Pouchet debate, that the two researchers and their supporters seem to have consistently \u0026ldquo;reproduced\u0026rdquo; one another\u0026rsquo;s experiments and reported different results might actually be the most serious break from scholarly civility in this debate. Both sides essentially accused one another of either purposely falsifying results or subconsciously fudging experiments so that they\u0026rsquo;d be consistent with their desired outcomes. That is a serious accusation for a scientist to make of another scientist. Questioning someone\u0026rsquo;s competence is one thing, but questioning their fundamental scientific ethics is quite another.\nThe Keim biography goes on, spilling generous ink to paint this scholarly debate in belligerent terms. And while the author tends towards hyperbole, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t discuss Pasteur\u0026rsquo;s other discoveries in the same wartime vocabulary. And even in more sober retellings, there\u0026rsquo;s no doubt that eventually the situation drew the attention of the French Academy of Sciences, which decided to force a resolution.\n The conflict assumed epic proportions. The sessions of the Academy of Sciences caught the echoes of it, each theory having its partizans, and each experimenter his enemies.\nKeim, 1914\n In 1862, the Academy announced a prize to go the researcher whose results, as judged by an Academy committee, best addressed the question of spontaneous generation. When Pasteur was declared the winner in 1862, spontaneous generation was essentially declared disproven by one of the most important scientific bodies in Europe.\nAccording to Keim, Pouchet and his chums refused to accept even this defeat and demanded one last chance to run their experiments for the Academy before mysteriously dropping the issue at the last minute on the day planned for the trials. Final humiliation for Pouchet or no, \u0026ldquo;after a hard campaign of several years Pasteur was at last triumphant.\u0026rdquo;\nSome of the historical Pasteur-Pouchet clash echoes in today\u0026rsquo;s disputes on the origin of life. And most tellingly in my mind, so has the public interest. True, public interest in the origin of life may have more closely reflected the actual state of research on spontaneous generation in Pasteur\u0026rsquo;s day than today\u0026rsquo;s mainly creationism-evolution oriented public origin of life debate tracks with modern scientific thought on the origin of life. But the core of that broader appeal is the same: the origin of life is a question that reaches far beyond the laboratory and touches that deeply human hunger to know where we come from and why we\u0026rsquo;re here. When we ask why debates on the origin of life within science sometimes get as heated as they do, it might help to remember that scientists feel that hunger too.\n","href":"https://elisecutts.com/blog/2021-01-14-origins/","title":"The origin of life debate has never been civil"},{"categories":"Astrobiology","content":"Oxygen is one of those things that nobody thinks about unless they either don\u0026rsquo;t have it or they\u0026rsquo;re a scientist. Either way, once you do start to think about oxygen, its usually not long until you start thinking there\u0026rsquo;s nothing more important in the universe.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about oxygen lately, and not because I\u0026rsquo;m suffocating. And naturally, I have become something of an oxygen conspiracy theorist. It\u0026rsquo;s everywhere! It\u0026rsquo;s pulling all the strings. Heck if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for covid, I\u0026rsquo;d be grabbing random passerbys on the street and screaming at them: \u0026ldquo;WHY CAN\u0026rsquo;T YOU SEE IT!?!\u0026rdquo;\nAhem. Not really, of course. If only I was actually as enthusiastic about science as conspiracy theorists are about conspiracy theories—I\u0026rsquo;d get a lot more done. But in any case, thinking about oxygen does lead to some interesting questions.\nLife in the darkest possible dark     It also leads to interesting places, like the deep, dark, and often bizzare \u0026ldquo;light-independent\u0026rdquo; ecosystems of this planet. Think caves, animal guts, underground, and in the deep sea—basically anywhere there\u0026rsquo;s no light to power photosynthesis. The connection between darkness and oxygen might not be immediately obvious, but take a second to think about where all that oxygen you\u0026rsquo;re enjoying right now comes from (probably a tree) and it might be a bit clearer where I\u0026rsquo;m going with this.\nI started down this rabbit hole after watching a Youtube video by Kurzgesagt about rogue planets called \u0026ldquo;Aliens under the Ice.\u0026quot; The video goes through research supporting the existence of liquid water oceans on terrestrial rogue planets1 and points to black smoker vents in the deep sea as an example of how life could get by on a world without a sun—in the darkest possible dark.\nThe idea of habitable rogues absolutely enchanted me. Just imagine—intelligent life evolving inside that would have no way of ever knowing that the universe didn\u0026rsquo;t end where the bottom of their planet\u0026rsquo;s ice sheet began. It makes you wonder what kind of fundamental limits there might be on what we\u0026rsquo;ll ever be able to see of the cosmos.\nI got to enjoy about a full five minutes of that kind of blissful fantasy before my brain turned back on and gently reminded me that black smoker ecosystems (at least as we know them on Earth today) just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work on a rogue planet.\nThey say science doesn\u0026rsquo;t ruin things but sometimes it really does.\nAnyways, the deep-sea hydrothermal vent food chain starts with chemosynthetic bacteria instead of photosynthetic plants. Unlike plants, these bacteria don\u0026rsquo;t need light to \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo; carbon dioxide as biologically-useful organic carbon. They use chemical energy to fix carbon instead, hence the \u0026ldquo;chemo\u0026rdquo; in chemosynthesis. Vent microbes get the energy they need for chemosynthesis by reacting chemical \u0026ldquo;food\u0026rdquo; spewed out by vents with oxygen dissolved in the surrounding seawater. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like how we get energy to live from reacting our food with the oxygen we breathe.\nBut that oxygen doesn\u0026rsquo;t come from nowhere. It comes from photosynthesis—photosynthesis that happens in the razor-thin layer of sunlit ocean that sits kilometers of empty, black ocean water above the vent ecosystems it indirectly sustains.\nSo even in the absolute darkness of the deep ocean, the complex ecosystems at hydrothermal vents still fundamentally rely on one of the products of photosynthesis.\nOf course, there are microbes that can run chemosynthesis without oxygen. Chemicals like sulfate, nitrate, and oxidized iron are decent substitutes and can fill in for oxygen in certain contexts2. But—of course—the reactions that produce these things in any abundance almost always require either oxygen or light (for a different kind of photosynthesis) to proceed. Sulfate, for instance, is one of the best oxygen-alternatives and is abundant in the ocean today but probably only existed in trace quantities before the rise of oxygen.\nNot so light-independent after all, then.\nTurn off photosynthesis and what\u0026rsquo;s left?     Turning off photosynthesis and taking oxygen completely out of the picture leaves us with just about the worst alternative \u0026ldquo;breathable\u0026rdquo; imaginable—carbon dioxide. There\u0026rsquo;s a reason you breath this stuff out and not in. But there are some microbes that make do with carbon dioxide anyways, reacting it with hydrogen gas to yield methane and a little bit (and it is a little bit) of energy. That energy can be used for chemosynthesis, meaning that these \u0026ldquo;autotrophic methanogens\u0026rdquo; are actually capable of existing without oxygen (or sulfate, etc.) or organic carbon produced by photosynthesis. So long as the oceans somehow remained liquid, autotrophic methanogens wouldn\u0026rsquo;t notice if someone turned off the sun.\nBut these guys aren\u0026rsquo;t the foundation of vent ecosystems. Reacting hydrogen with carbon dioxide this way barely provides enough energy to be worth doing at all. It just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be possible to sustain an amount of biomass comperable to that we see at a black smoker today if autotrophic methanogenesis were the only game in chemosynthesis town.\nSo, turn off photosynthesis and what do we have left at our teeming deep-sea oasis? Not much: autotrophic methanogens at the base of the food chain producing methane and organic carbon to build their own cells, other microbes breaking down the dead leftovers of those methanogens into small organic molecules via fermentation, and another kind of methanogen (\u0026ldquo;hetertrophic\u0026rdquo;) combining oxygen with those small organic molecules for energy and releasing yet more methane in the process.\nI imagine it\u0026rsquo;d look more like a slimy patch than an oasis. And if you did expose it to oxygen and light a match nearby, it would probably catch fire pretty easily thanks to all that methane.\nFun things to imagine.\nAnyways, good news— autotrophic methanogenesis is actually a candidate for the \u0026ldquo;first metabolism\u0026rdquo; among scientists who think life started at alkaline hydrothermal vents (not black smokers, a different kind)3. So depending on your preferred flavor of origin-of-life hypothesis, all this oxygen doom-and-gloom doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily preclude life on rogue worlds.\nIs there a truly light-independent ecosystem on Earth?     If black smokers—the poster-child for light-independent life on Earth—depend on photosynthesis even though they\u0026rsquo;re leagues (ha-ha ocean words) away from any noteworthy source of light, that begs the question: are there any truly light-independent ecosystems on Earth?\nPerhaps I should say natural ecosystems. Of course someone could throw some microbes in a box, seal it up, put it in the dark, and say \u0026ldquo;tah-dah, I\u0026rsquo;ve done it! A light-independent ecosystem!\u0026rdquo; But that\u0026rsquo;s not interesting. We already know that there are limited kinds of carbon fixation that can run without light, oxygen, or a good substitute for oxygen. I\u0026rsquo;m more interested in whether or not there are any corners of the Earth where those limited forms of carbon fixation are still the foundation of an ecosystem.\nUsually when we say we\u0026rsquo;re talking about\u0026quot;light-independent\u0026rdquo; ecosystems, we\u0026rsquo;re really talking about ecosystems that don\u0026rsquo;t rely on photosynthesis for organic carbon. But as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen, that isn\u0026rsquo;t the whole story. Photosynthesis has more than one product. In addition to organic carbon, it produces oxygen—there are also some kinds of photosynthesis that produce substances like elemental sulfur or nitrate that can serve as \u0026ldquo;oxygen substitutes.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, when we ask if an ecosystem is \u0026ldquo;light-independent,\u0026rdquo; we\u0026rsquo;re really asking two questions. First, does life in this ecosystem rely on photosynthesis for organic carbon? And does it rely on photosynthesis for something else?\nMost dark places aren\u0026rsquo;t really \u0026ldquo;light-independent\u0026rdquo;     Most dark places are automatically ruled out just by asking the first question. It\u0026rsquo;s dark in your small intestine (hopefully), but unless you\u0026rsquo;re eating Riftia worms dredged up fresh from a nearby hydrothermal vent for every meal, the organic carbon in there should all have ultimately derived from photosynthesis. Life in caves usually relies at least a little on organic carbon from the sunny outside, even if chemosynthesis is a major player. Organisms that live in deep sea sediments away from hydrothermal vents also rely on organic carbon that drifts down from the sunlit surface as marine snow.\nMany of the well-known \u0026ldquo;anaerobic\u0026rdquo; or oxygen-free places on Earth can be excluded for the same reason. Sediments and waters in oxygen-poor lakes, deep layers of soil, rice paddies, hypoxic ocean \u0026ldquo;dead zones,\u0026rdquo; sewage treatement pants, even some infected wounds are all pretty much oxygen-free and many are dark, but life there relies on organic carbon produced by photosynthesis. They\u0026rsquo;re not truly \u0026ldquo;light-independent\u0026rdquo;\nStill, there are a few places where life gets by without any photosynthetic organic carbon at all. We\u0026rsquo;ve already discussed hydrothermal vents. There are also other kinds of undersea geologic systems that support chemosynthetic ecosystems, and even a handful of weird caves where the food chain is entirely based on chemosynthesis. Movile Cave in Romania is one such place—the cave is so isolated that all life there has been cut off from the outside world for over 5 million years.\nThese places support some truly remarkable and odd wildlife, including a host of animals that often looks more like something out of a Star Trek episode than a fellow denizen of planet Earth. Vents support octopus, crabs, fish, shrimp, mussels, and tubeworms a meter long. And in Movile Cave, there are an array of arthropod species and fungi, and even a few leeches (makes me wonder: whose blood are they drinking?).\nBut all those animals should be a red flag. Where there are animals, there is at least some oxygen4. We\u0026rsquo;ve already been through the oxygen problem for hydrothermal vents. And even though the air in Movile Cave is very low in oxygen, it still contains enough for its animal inhabitants to breathe (but not enough for you).\nAnd the winner is…     The only place I can think of that meets both criteria for true \u0026ldquo;light independence\u0026rdquo; is the ocean crust itself. The microbes that live in seafloor sediments depend in large part on organic carbon that sinks down from the sunlit surface, but underneath that sediment is the real ocean floor: a kind of black volcanic rock called basalt. As water percolates through tiny veins in seafloor basalt, it causes a chemical reaction called serpentinization to occur, slowly generating hydrogen. And since the seawater also contains carbon dioxide, serpentinization can provide enough chemical energy for some very lonely autotrophic methanogens to go about their boring business.\nThere are almost certainly a few other places on Earth where similar conditions exist as well, but it is hard to imagine the inhabitants looking all that different. And if you\u0026rsquo;ll remember, this is pretty much identical to the scenario I outlined earlier for what a rogue planet biosphere might look like. So if you want to see an alien, just go dredge up a rock from the deep sea and whip out a microscope.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy and exciting and to imagine life in the dark, but start thinking about where the organic carbon and especially where the oxygen comes from in \u0026ldquo;dark\u0026rdquo; ecosystems and it becomes clear very quickly just how revolutionary photosynthesis has been for the Earth. The world as we experience it can only exist because cyanobacteria figured out photosynthesis a few million years ago—and even the places we think of as the most alien and remote have almost all been irreversibly touched by this special metabolism. In that light, it\u0026rsquo;s remarkable that there is any life at all out there that managed to make it through the oxygen revoultion without noticing, that there truly is a light-independent ecosystem on this planet.\nEven if it is a pretty boring one.\n  A quick aside—the authors of the paper claiming that ice-covered oceans could exist on rogue planets absolutely nailed the name for their ocean worlds, which I\u0026rsquo;m honestly a bit disappointed Kurzgesagt didn\u0026rsquo;t pick up: Steppenwolf planets. Steppenwolf is German for \u0026ldquo;steppe wolf\u0026rdquo; and the authors imagine that—and I quote—\u0026ldquo;any life in this strange habitat would exist like a lone wolf wandering the galactic steppe.\u0026rdquo; Someone clearly thought he was a poet. Or maybe the authors were just DC comic fans.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I purposely avoided getting into the details too much in this post since they\u0026rsquo;re not necessary to get the main point. But for anyone interested, the difference between good and bad substitutes for oxygen comes down to redox (reduction-oxidation) chemistry. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in geobiology or astrobiology, redox chemistry is an important concept to understand because it can be used to predict how much energy is available to life in a given environment. This review from Astrobiology Magazine covers the basics for anyone interested.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Again: alkaline vents. NOT black smokers! The vent origin of life people take this veeeerrrry seriously.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n There is a recently discovered exception to this rule: some tiny, weird animals that live in a briny layer of water at the bottom of the Meditteranean. But as a general rule, animals need oxygen at least some of the time, even if they can get by without it for a while.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","href":"https://elisecutts.com/blog/2020-12-19-oxygen/","title":"Is there a truly light-independent ecosystem?"}]
