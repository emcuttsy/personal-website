[{"categories":["About"],"content":"For those of us who aren’t computer gods, the sheer number of options when it comes to making websites can be enough to start the brain dribbling out one ear even without all the jargon and code involved. But we mere mortals often need websites, too. This one was built using Hugo with the blogdown R package and is hosted for free on Netlify. Of course, there’s no one right way to make a website. This setup just happens to work well for me. I just hope that sharing my experience—both with a popular web design service and with my current, Markdown-based setup—might go a little way towards making this whole website business a bit less brain-dribbling-out-the-ear for you.

So when I decided to make a personal website, I originally registered my domain with Wix and used their WYSIWYG website editor to build and maintain my site for years. WYSIWYG stands for “What You See Is What You Get,” and it essentially means what it says. A WYSIWYG editor shows the designer what the final product will look like, not a pile of code that then later gets rendered into a final product.
