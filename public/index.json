Either way, once you do start to think about oxygen, its usually not long until you start thinking there’s nothing more important in the universe. I’ve been thinking a lot about oxygen lately, and not because I’m suffocating. And naturally, I have become something of an O$_2$ conspiracy theorist. It’s everywhere! It’s pulling all the strings. Heck if it weren’t for covid, I’d be grabbing random passerbys on the street and screaming at them: “WHY CAN’T YOU SEE IT!?!” Ahem. Not really, of course. If only I was actually as enthusiastic about science as conspiracy theorists are about conspiracy theories—I’d get a lot more done. But in any case, thinking about O$_2$ does lead to some interesting questions.

Think caves, animal guts, underground, and in the deep sea—basically anywhere there’s no light to power photosynthesis. The connection between darkness and oxygen might not be immediately obvious, but take a second to think about where all that O$_2$ you’re enjoying right now comes from (probably a tree) and it might be a bit clearer where I’m going with this. I started down this rabbit hole after watching a Youtube video by Kurzgesagt about rogue planets called “Aliens under the Ice.\" The video goes through research supporting the existence of liquid water oceans on terrestrial rogue planets1 and points to black smoker vents in the deep sea as an example of how life could get by on a world without a sun—in the darkest possible dark. The idea of habitable rogues absolutely enchanted me. Just imagine—intelligent life evolving inside that would have no way of ever knowing that the universe didn’t end where the bottom of their planet’s ice sheet began. It makes you wonder what kind of fundamental limits there might be on what we’ll ever be able to see of the cosmos. I got to enjoy about a full five minutes of that kind of blissful fantasy before my brain turned back on and gently reminded me that black smoker ecosystems (at least as we know them on Earth today) just wouldn’t work on a rogue planet. They say science doesn’t ruin things but sometimes it really does. Anyways, the deep-sea hydrothermal vent food chain starts with chemosynthetic bacteria instead of photosynthetic plants. Unlike plants, these bacteria don’t need light to “fix” CO$_2$ as biologically-useful organic carbon. They use chemical energy to fix carbon instead, hence the “chemo” in chemosynthesis. Vent microbes get the energy they need for chemosynthesis by reacting chemical “food” spewed out by vents with oxygen dissolved in the surrounding seawater. It’s a bit like how we get energy to live from reacting our food with the oxygen we breathe. But that oxygen doesn’t come from nowhere. It comes from photosynthesis—photosynthesis that happens in the razor-thin layer of sunlit ocean that sits kilometers of empty, black ocean water above the vent ecosystems it indirectly sustains. So even in the absolute darkness of the deep ocean, the complex ecosystems at hydrothermal vents still fundamentally rely on one of the products of photosynthesis. Of course, there are microbes that can run chemosynthesis without oxygen. Chemicals like sulfate, nitrate, and oxidized iron are decent substitutes and can fill in for oxygen in certain contexts2. But—of course—the reactions that produce these things in any abundance almost always require either oxygen or light (for a different kind of photosynthesis) to proceed. Sulfate, for instance, is one of the best oxygen-alternatives and is abundant in the ocean today but probably only existed in trace quantities before the rise of oxygen. Not so light-independent after all, then.

Turning off photosynthesis and taking O$_2$ completely out of the picture leaves us with just about the worst alternative “breathable” imaginable—CO$_2$. There’s a reason you breath this stuff out and not in. But there are some microbes that make do with CO$_2$ anyways, reacting it with hydrogen gas to yield methane and a little bit (and it is a little bit) of energy. That energy can be used for chemosynthesis, meaning that these “autotrophic methanogens” are actually capable of existing without oxygen (or sulfate, etc.) or organic carbon produced by photosynthesis. So long as the oceans somehow remained liquid, autotrophic methanogens wouldn’t notice if someone turned off the sun. But these guys aren’t the foundation of vent ecosystems. Reacting H$_2$ with CO$_2$ this way barely provides enough energy to be worth doing at all. It just wouldn’t be possible to sustain an amount of biomass comperable to that we see at a black smoker today if autotrophic methanogenesis were the only game in chemosynthesis town. So, turn off photosynthesis and what do we have left at our teeming deep-sea oasis? Not much: autotrophic methanogens at the base of the food chain producing CH$_4$ and organic carbon to build their own cells, other microbes breaking down the dead leftovers of those methanogens into small organic molecules via fermentation, and another kind of methanogen (“hetertrophic”) combining CO$_2$ with those small organic molecules for energy and releasing yet more CH$_4$ in the process. I imagine it’d look more like a slimy patch than an oasis. And if you did expose it to oxygen and light a match nearby, it would probably catch fire pretty easily thanks to all that methane. Fun things to imagine. Anyways, good news—autotrophic methanogenesis is actually a candidate for the “first metabolism” among scientists who think life started at alkaline hydrothermal vents (not black smokers, a different kind)3. So depending on your preferred flavor of origin-of-life hypothesis, all this oxygen doom-and-gloom doesn’t necessarily preclude life on rogue worlds.

If black smokers—the poster-child for light-independent life on Earth—depend on photosynthesis even though they’re leagues (ha-ha ocean words) away from any noteworthy source of light, that begs the question: are there any truly light-independent ecosystems on Earth? Perhaps I should say natural ecosystems. Of course someone could throw some microbes in a box, seal it up, put it in the dark, and say “ta-da, I’ve done it! A light-independent ecosystem!” But that’s not interesting. We already know that there are limited kinds of carbon fixation that can run without light, oxygen, or a good substitute for oxygen. I’m more interested in whether or not there are any corners of the Earth where those limited forms of carbon fixation are still the foundation of an ecosystem. Usually when we say we’re talking about\"light-independent” ecosystems, we’re really talking about ecosystems that don’t rely on photosynthesis for organic carbon. But as we’ve seen, that isn’t the whole story. Photosynthesis has more than one product. In addition to organic carbon, it produces oxygen—there are also some kinds of photosynthesis that produce substances like elemental sulfur or nitrate that can serve as “oxygen substitutes.” So, when we ask if an ecosystem is “light-independent,” we’re really asking two questions. First, does life in this ecosystem rely on photosynthesis for organic carbon? And does it rely on photosynthesis for something else?

It’s dark in your small intestine (hopefully), but unless you’re eating Riftia worms dredged up fresh from a nearby hydrothermal vent for every meal, the organic carbon in there should all have ultimately derived from photosynthesis. Life in caves usually relies at least a little on input of organic carbon from the sunny outside, even if chemosynthesis helps make up the difference. Life in the deep sea and in sediments away from hydrothermal vents also relies on organic carbon that drifts down from the sunlit surface. Many of the well-known “anaerobic” or oxygen-free places on Earth can be excluded for the same reason. Sediments and waters in oxygen-poor lakes, deep layers of soil, rice paddies, hypoxic ocean “dead zones,” sewage treatement pants, even some infected wounds are all pretty much oxygen-free and many are dark, but life there relies on organic carbon produced by photosynthesis. They’re not truly “light-independent” Still, there are a few places where life gets by without any photosynthetic organic carbon at all. We’ve already discussed hydrothermal vents. There are also other kinds of undersea geologic systems that support chemosynthetic ecosystems, and even a handful of weird caves where the food chain is entirely based on chemosynthesis. Movile Cave in Romania is one such place—the cave is so isolated that all life there has been cut off from the outside world for over 5 million years. These places support some truly remarkable and odd wildlife, including a host of animals that often looks more like its from a Star Trek episode than from the planet Earth. Vents support octopus, crabs, fish, shrimp, mussels, and tubeworms a meter long. And in Movile Cave, there are an array of arthropod species and fungi, and even a few leeches (makes me wonder: whose blood are they drinking?). But all those animals should be a red flag. Where there are animals, there is at least some oxygen4. We’ve already been through the oxygen problem for hydrothermal vents. And even though the air in Movile Cave is very low in oxygen, it still contains enough for its animal inhabitants to breathe (but not enough for you).

The microbes that live in seafloor sediments depend in large part on organic carbon that sinks down from the sunlit surface, but underneath that sediment is the real ocean floor: a kind of black volcanic rock called basalt. As water percolates through tiny veins in the basalt, it causes a chemical reaction called serpentinization to occur, slowly generating H$_2$. And since the seawater also contains CO$_2$, there is apparently enough chemical energy around for some very lonely autotrophic methanogens to go about their boring business down there. Maybe there are a few other places on Earth where similar conditions exist as well, but it is hard to imagine the inhabitants looking all that different. And if you’ll remember, this is pretty much identical to the scenario I outlined earlier for what a rogue planet biosphere might look like. So if you want to see an alien, just go dredge up a rock from the deep sea and whip out a microscope. Still, even if they’re about what I expected, I was still pretty surprised to find out about these basalt methanogens living in true isolation. It’s easy to imagine life in the dark at first, but start thinking about where the organic carbon and especially where the O$_2$ comes from and it becomes clear very quickly just how revolutionary photosynthesis has been for the Earth. The world as we experience it can only exist because a few million years ago cyanobacteria figured out photosynthesis—and even the places we think of as the most alien and remote have all been irreversibly touched by this special metabolism. In that light, it’s remarkable that there is any life at all out there that managed to make it through the oxygen revoultion without noticing, that there truly is a light-independent ecosystem on this planet. It’s just a pretty boring one. A quick aside—the authors of the paper claiming that ice-covered oceans could exist on rogue planets absolutely nailed the name for their ocean worlds, which I’m honestly a bit disappointed Kurzgesagt didn’t pick up: Steppenwolf planets. Steppenwolf is German for “steppe wolf” and the authors imagine that—and I quote—“any life in this strange habitat would exist like a lone wolf wandering the galactic steppe.” Someone clearly thought he was a poet. Or maybe the authors were just DC comic fans. ↩︎ I purposely avoided getting into the details too much in this post since they’re not necessary to get the main point. But for anyone interested, the difference between good and bad substitutes for oxygen comes down to redox (reduction-oxidation) chemistry. If you’re interested in geobiology or astrobiology, redox chemistry is an important concept to understand because it can be used to predict how much energy is available to life in a given environment. This review from Astrobiology Magazine covers the basics for anyone interested. ↩︎ Again: alkaline vents. NOT black smokers! The vent origin of life people take this veeeerrrry seriously. ↩︎ There is a recently discovered exception to this rule: some tiny, weird animals that live in a briny layer of water at the bottom of the Meditteranean. But as a general rule, animals need oxygen at least some of the time, even if they can get by without it for a while. ↩︎ ","date":"2020-12-19","objectID":"/is-there-a-truly-light-independent-ecosystem/:2:2","tags":["geobiology","photosynthesis","microbial ecology"],"title":"Is there a truly light-independent ecosystem?","uri":"/is-there-a-truly-light-independent-ecosystem/"},{"categories":[],"content":"Update: improved card format available I’ve kept working on my Anki card format and now have a much better template than the one I use in this deck.

The class will reorient its focus in a microbial direction here in the upcoming weeks, but thinking about familiar groups of macroscopic organisms to start makes it a lot easier to get a grip on fundamental concepts in phylogenomics and evolution. Microbes are neat. But would anyone really argue that dinosaurs aren’t at least a bit neat-er? The course instructor, Prof. Fournier, tends to ask us a lot of questions encouraging us to come up with examples of certain evolutionary relationships (check out this list of phylogenetic terms if you’re interested). But some of his questions are just about sharing fun facts. I love fun facts. Last lecture, as we were discussing differences between eukaryotic and microbial evolution, Prof. Fournier pointed out that, in general, microbes evolve by expanding their metabolic capabilities whereas complex multicellular life usually responds to selective pressure by evolving new structures—think hands for grasping, fins for swimming, etc. Microbes easily adapt their entire cellular toolboxes for survival under extreme conditions—acidity, lack of oxygen, high temperatures, etc. Complex life can’t do that so well, since it’s, well, complex. And complexity is great for things like evolving hands and discovering fire, but it can actually get in the way of survival under extreme conditions. There are just too many interdependent moving parts in a complex organism to allow for the kind of easy metabolic mix-and-match that microbes get away with. Evolving new body plans and parts will only get you so far if you need to start breathing iron or keep your DNA from unzipping at boiling temperatures. That’s why you’ll find bacteria happily munching away on toxic gas abd living in boiling hot springs and lakes full of arsenic while animals, plants, and (to a lesser degree) fungi tend to need to more clement habitats with plenty of oxygen and food to consume. But hold on, that’s not even the fun fact. I’m getting there. Microbes account for the vast majority of life’s metabolic diveristy. And spend enough time in geobiology courses and it’s pretty easy to begin to think that there’s no limit to what bacteria and archaea can overcome. Compared to “higher” lifeforms they can seem downright indestructable—at least on the level of populations. Sure, individual bugs might not survive in some inhospitable environment, but there’s almost always a weird relative or two a few branches over on the tree of life that finds that same boiling hot spring or melt-your-face-off acid pool downright cozy. So I was a bit puzzled at first when Prof. Fournier followed up his point about structural vs. metabolic evolution by asking “what is the one extreme environmental condition that complex life, especially vertebrates, has more successfully overcome than microbes?” A puzzle. It took the class a while to figure it out. But we did. It’s cold. A handful of mammals, birds, and fish have independently evolved ways to survive, maintain activity, and reproduce at sub-zero temperatures, but microbes haven’t. Prof. Founrier explained that even the most “cryophilic” microbes can’t maintain metabolic activity at just a few degrees below 0 C. In brine pockets with enough salinity to keep water liquid below freezing temperatures, microbes still don’t cope well if it gets too cold. Metabolic reactions required for maintaining cell integrity, growing and reproducing grind to a halt below freezing. Big lifeforms can generate enough heat to warm themselves, but microbes can’t. They’re just too small, their surface-area to voulme ratio just too enormous—that is, relative to their size, microbes have a lot less interior volume that could be used to run heat-producing reactions than external surface area through which any generated heat escapes.

And on top of all that, my mattress won’t be here for another week! They said 3-5 days 14 days ago! Whining aside, after two wonderful months with Clemens in Denmark, I’ve arrived safe and sound in Boston (Somerville, really) to start my PhD.

There are almost certainly some other, more low-key viruses just minding their own business in my nose wondering what drove me to stick a cotton swab up there. Anwyays, I know that I don’t have COVID-19 because I was tested the day after I arrived in Boston. Massachusetts has a pretty strict 14-day quarantine requirement for travellers from anywhere outside of New England and New York, but if you test negative you’re free to move around. It’s unclear if or how this will be enforced, but I wanted to play along and respect the health of my roommates by getting a test. The test was definitely more of a formality than anything else, though, since Denmark (among plenty of other countries) is actually doing a lot better COVID-wise than even success-story US states like MA. The quarantine requirement for all international travellers strikes me as more of a punishment than a justified pandemic control measure. Getting a test wasn’t as straightforward as I anticiapted—mostly because I didn’t anticipate. If you call a few weeks in advance, there are free testing centers that serve most neighborhoods in greater Boston. Even asymptomatic people can get tested for free there. But I didn’t think in advance. Ultimately, got a test by signing up for a primary care provider through MIT Medical. After doing that, I was able to get a test there, since that’s where I get my primary care (as of a the day I booked the test). I wanted a PCP, so bonus! Not-bonus: It turns out, MIT policy requires returning international travellers to quarantine for 7 days before testing them or allowing them on campus for any reason. The nurse who took my test was very nice about telling me this, but in the future I’ll need to plan ahead a bit better. That all taken care of, I can move on from travel and testing concerns. Now it’s time to focus on getting started here which, until my research poject gets going, will mean a lot of MIT onboarding and waiting around for Amazon deliveries. Anyways, not a particularly unique story from this time of non-complimentary and often overlapping institutional and governmental COVID-19 policies. The upshot is, I’m safe in Boston.

Course content week-by-week Week 1: short introduction to Python, the Spyder IDE, core elements of a program, strings, bindings, control flow, iteration Week 2: floats and fractions, basic programs incl. bisection search \u0026 the Newton-Raphson approximation for square roots, functions, scope, keyword arguments, iteration vs recursion, recursive algorithms incl. Towers of Hanoi and calculation of Fibonacci numbers, file handling Week 3: tuples, lists, mutable vs immutable types, dictionaries, functions as objects, calculating the Fibonacci numbers using dictionaries, more on scope, global variables Week 4: debugging, designing test suites, classes of tests, reading code, exception handling, assertions, exceptions Week 5: classes, inheritance, class methods, object oriented programming, heierarchies, using inherited methods, building a “gradebook” class as an example of classes and inheritance, generators Week 6: computational complexity, program efficiency, Big Oh notation, complexity classes, searching and sorting algorithms incl. linear search, bisection search, bogo and bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort Week 7 (optional): visualizing results, overlapping displays, changing data displays, adding documentation to displays These principles underpin programming in any language and provide an important foundation for computer scientists. And it is very much MIT’s style to focus on the more theoretical, abstract side of things and leave application to the imagination of the student. But I can’t help but think it could be a bit too much too fast. Especially for true beginners. Generally, it seems that 6.00.1x is considered a tough introduction course. The Reddit threads I went through were positive towards the course. But they also nearly always noted that it was very rigorous, and perhaps not even suitable for beginners. The “Course Philosophy” page of 6.00.1x suggests that while students with no programming experience can succeed, they should expect to spend up to 15 hrs per week on coursework in order to do so. This all despite MIT describing the course as “designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming” with a focus on breadth rather than depth.\" ","date":"2020-08-19","objectID":"/2020-08-19-review-mitx-6001-x-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python/:1:0","tags":["review","edX course review","Python"],"title":"Review: MITx 6001.x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python","uri":"/2020-08-19-review-mitx-6001-x-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python/"},{"categories":["Reviews"],"content":"Emphasis on the “Computer Science” not on the “Programming in Python” The course assignments and examples are all in Python, and you certainly get good practice with Python along the way. In particular, I thought the course did a great job teaching students to read Python code written by others, which is a very important skill for scientists since we’re often the end-users of programs and not the designers. But the course definitely doesn’t focus on teaching Python programming. It teaches programming, period—the material just happens to be in Python. This could be good or bad for you, depending on your needs. If you’re looking for an introduction to general computer science concepts, 6.00.1x is a thorough introduction to those ideas. But if you’re not, you might be better served by a more practically-oriented course. This is especially true for folks already familiar with fundamental computer science ideas who are just looking to get up to speed on Python—6.00.1x is not a Python crash course.

Personally, I didn’t find the course absurdly hard. I spent about 3.5 hours a week on the class—1.5 hours going through the lectures and finger exercises (many thanks to whoever put a 1.25 speed button on the videos) and about 2 hours on the problem sets. I didn’t have any problems with the exams, and didn’t need to study or review outside of watching the video lectures to keep up. However, when I read through the forums I saw that some of my classmates were spending over 10 hours on problem sets each week. I definitely had some advantages that made things easier for me. While I’m not a programmer by any means, I do have some limited experience writing code. Also, hanging around computer nerds at Caltech meant that I already got the “just Stack Overflow everything” lecture, which, for an intro class like this, really does solve most problems. Is 6.00.1x a good choice for absolute beginners? I wrote this review with scientists learning to code in mind—not the typical beginner looking to dip their feet into computer science and programming. The material covered by 6.00.1x is quite dense, and the course doesn’t address applications for programming at all. But researchers often learn to code with a particular application in mind and have STEM backgrounds that prepare them well for abstract thinking. So for scientists and grad students, I think 6.00.1x is a fine choice of introductory computer science course. But for the typical beginner, I think there are probably better options. One popular choice is the HarvardX course CS50, which is much broader than 6.00.1x and introduces students to multiple programming languages and applications. There’s also Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. This free online textbook aims to help absolute beginners use code in useful ways as quickly as possible. I also didn’t try to perfectly understand every concept, especially the more abstract ones like computational complexity. If I had wanted to do that, I would have needed to put in a lot more time. Which brings me to my next point… ","date":"2020-08-19","objectID":"/2020-08-19-review-mitx-6001-x-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python/:1:2","tags":["review","edX course review","Python"],"title":"Review: MITx 6001.x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python","uri":"/2020-08-19-review-mitx-6001-x-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python/"},{"categories":["Reviews"],"content":"You get out what you put in While 6.00.1x is tough, it provides plenty of support and resources to get you through. And if you find assignments easy, those same supports and resources offer a great way to enhance and extend your experience with the course. The instructor-paced format of 6.00.1x definitely contributes to the difficulty of the course, it also leads to a very active, supportive community of peers. If you’re struggling, you will easily be able to find people to work with on problem sets. You’ll also find plenty of classmates posting little challenges (“code this assignment in one line!\") and expansions to the material povided by the course. Optional course textbook There’s an optional textbook written by the instructor that supports the course. I personally didn’t use the textbook, but other students seem to have found it a great support. The TAs are also quite active and helpful. I frequently saw them answering questions and clarifying ideas in the forums and comments sections. I definitely didn’t put in maximal effort to the course when I did it. I watched the lectures and solved the problems, but I never went further than that. It’s definitely possible to float through some of the material in this course without understanding it. I definitely didn’t study hard enough to grasp everything 100%—just well enough to complete the assignments. I kind of regret my apathy now. There were so many opportunities to engage with other students in a way that would have enhanced my learning. Computational Thinking Using Python XSeries 6.00.1x is the first course in a two-part “XSeries” offered by MITx called Computaitonal Thinking Using Python. The second coure in the series, MITx 6.00.2x Introduciton to Computational Thinking and Data Science, is more application-focused and introduces tools in Python that are useful for data analysis and visualization.

It was sometimes difficult to stay focused enough to keep from tabbing out to other webpages. However, for the most part, I was able to stay focused thanks to the way 6.00.1x breaks lectures up into 3-15 minute sections. Between each section, students are tasked with solving a set of short problems or “finger exercises” related to the previous lecture section. I found that this way of presenting material helped me pay better attention than I usually would to a video lecture.

The sets are fair, generally have clear directions, and—best of all—are completely possible to finish correctly without teaching yourself anything that wasn’t introduced in lecture. However, they’re not the most exciting or gratifying. For programs more complicated than a few lines, a lot of the code is already written for you and you’re simply tasked with modifying it. This makes things easy, but it’s tough to feel like you’re actually capable of building anything yourself based on the course experience. And as I’ve said before, the course does not emphasize applied or useful programming. In the problem sets, you won’t write code that visualizes data or does a task more useful than calculating Fibonnaci numbers. The most exciting assignment was a “hangman”-style word-guessing game.

I was able to get through the lectures and problem sets without difficulty and felt that my comfort level with Python—especially reading Python—improved. I also feel more confident with basic computer science concepts than I did before. However, if I could do things over, I might choose to take a more data science targeted introduction to Python course, or at least one that was more applied. At least I am planning to continue with the next course in the Computational Thinking Using Python XSeries, so hopefully I’ll get some exposure to data applications there. Expect another review after that’s done! I just want to finish off by saying that, for all my critiques of 6.00.1x, it accomplished something really important for me: alleviating my anxiety around programming. Personally, coding was never really my cup of tea. I chose to major in geobiology in part because I saw it as a sort of last refuge from the tyrrany of screens. Just the thought of programming gave me little panic attacks because I felt so out of my depth with technology and thought there was no way I could catch up to the tech bros who had been taking apart computers with their dads from the age of 3. I never considered myself a computer person, and did my best to avoid programming whenever I could. At least I didn’t consider myself a computer person. Maybe I’m getting there now—the fact that you can, I assume, access this website, indicates that some progress has been made at least. Anyways, 6.00.1x got me over thinking “there’s no way I can do this.” Maybe it’s a bit sick, but seeing others struggle in the forums on problems I found easy made me feel a lot better about my ability to keep going with this stuff. And I found myself really enjoying figuring out the problem sets. It felt a bit like doing a crossword or sudok. I still don’t think there’s any way I’ll become a developer or anything like that. But that’s the thing—you don’t need to be a developer to use programming to make your life easier. I realize now that thinking otherwise is about as ridiculous as thinking that you need to be mechanic in order to drive a car. If you’re like me and intimidation is your biggest problem, the nice thing is that it doesn’t really matter what course you take first: just being guided to the realization that you’re capable of coding is enough.
