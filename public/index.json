[{"categories":["Science Drabbles","Geobiology"],"content":"The public origin of life debate sometimes feels like a parallel universe to the scientific one. And in many ways, it really is a parallel debate.—the big questions have almost nothing to do with one antoher and, more fundamentally, the battle raging beyond the ivory tower has more to do with faith than research. According to a 2019 Gallup poll, 40% of Americans believe that God created humans in their current form no more than about 10,000 years ago. And if that’s your view, it doesn’t much matter whether the person you’re debating thinks that life got started at a hydrothermal vent on the bottom of the ocean or in a warm little pond of primordial soup. That’s just not the point. Given that the creationism debate tends to pit “science” vs “religion,” there isn’t usually much room (and often too much risk) to dig into the finer points of current scientific thought on life’s origins. Putting up a divided fron’t isn’t usually a great way to win an argument, and and given that evolution is one of the most important cornerstones of modern biology (including the ongoing research on COVID-19 that will eventually allow life to return to normal), it’s best not to mess around. It’s better to stick to the main line: Researchers almost unilaterally agree that all life evolved from a common ancestor, and that life must have emerged from non-life at least once at least 3.5 billion years ago. But that’s about where the agreement ends. And where the disagreement begins, so does the nastiness. Ask anyone with so much as a toe in the astrobiology waters and they’ll tell you that the origins debate is a can of worms best left unopened unless you’re writing a thesis in worm physiology. And interestingly, it’s not clear that there was a time in which that wasn’t the case—even back before we could agree where worms actually come from. Up until the mid-19th century, the most important scientific question regarding the origin of life was that of spontaneous generation. Spontaneous generation was the belief that new living things regularly formed out of non-living material without descent from other living things. Small animals like insects and organisms like fungi, plants, and fish whose reproductive cycles either don’t look like ours or are hard to observe in particular were thought to arise this way. Leave food to rot and it will turn into flies and mice. Leave a pile of soil for a while and you’ll cook yourself up a fresh batch of worms. That disproving this idea was a major step towards our current understanding of evolution and the common descent of life has something of an ironic aftertaste today considering that today’s origin of life debate hinges entirely on how such “spontaneous generation” might really have happened—how physics, chemistry, and geology could come together to produce biology. One should not be too hasty to throw today’s hypotheses into the same, sinking boat as spontaneous generation, however. Beyond the obvious distinctions to be drawn between modern research and the natural philosophy of bygone centuries, abiogenesis as we conceptualize it today and spontaneous generation are very different ideas. Spontaneous generation was considered to be a commonplace process necessary for replenishing populations of certain organisms, but researchers now tend to consider the origin of life to be a rare, potentially once-in-a-universe event requiring very specific circumstances unique to the early Earth—and which is definitely not how worms are made. There are documented experiments on spontaneous generation dating back as far as the 16th century, and throughout the 18th century researchers produced a series of results that we today would probably accept as conclusive evidence that broth does not spontaneously transform into bacteria and that you can’t whip up a fresh batch of mice from soiled cloth and a bit of old grain. That the old doctrine would be tested during this time makes perfect sense when seen in the light of another doctr","date":"2021-01-14","objectID":"/the-origin-of-life-debate-has-never-been-civil/:0:0","tags":["origin of life","geobiology","history of science"],"title":"The origin of life debate has never been civil","uri":"/the-origin-of-life-debate-has-never-been-civil/"},{"categories":["Geobiology","Science Drabbles"],"content":"Oxygen is one of those things that nobody thinks about unless they either don’t have it or they’re a scientist. Either way, once you do start to think about oxygen, its usually not long until you start thinking there’s nothing more important in the universe. I’ve been thinking a lot about oxygen lately, and not because I’m suffocating. And naturally, I have become something of an O$_2$ conspiracy theorist. It’s everywhere! It’s pulling all the strings. Heck if it weren’t for covid, I’d be grabbing random passerbys on the street and screaming at them: “WHY CAN’T YOU SEE IT!?!” Ahem. Not really, of course. If only I was actually as enthusiastic about science as conspiracy theorists are about conspiracy theories—I’d get a lot more done. But in any case, thinking about O$_2$ does lead to some interesting questions.

Think caves, animal guts, underground, and in the deep sea—basically anywhere there’s no light to power photosynthesis. The connection between darkness and oxygen might not be immediately obvious, but take a second to think about where all that O$_2$ you’re enjoying right now comes from (probably a tree) and it might be a bit clearer where I’m going with this. I started down this rabbit hole after watching a Youtube video by Kurzgesagt about rogue planets called “Aliens under the Ice.\" The video goes through research supporting the existence of liquid water oceans on terrestrial rogue planets1 and points to black smoker vents in the deep sea as an example of how life could get by on a world without a sun—in the darkest possible dark. The idea of habitable rogues absolutely enchanted me. Just imagine—intelligent life evolving inside that would have no way of ever knowing that the universe didn’t end where the bottom of their planet’s ice sheet began. It makes you wonder what kind of fundamental limits there might be on what we’ll ever be able to see of the cosmos. I got to enjoy about a full five minutes of that kind of blissful fantasy before my brain turned back on and gently reminded me that black smoker ecosystems (at least as we know them on Earth today) just wouldn’t work on a rogue planet. They say science doesn’t ruin things but sometimes it really does. Anyways, the deep-sea hydrothermal vent food chain starts with chemosynthetic bacteria instead of photosynthetic plants. Unlike plants, these bacteria don’t need light to “fix” CO$_2$ as biologically-useful organic carbon. They use chemical energy to fix carbon instead, hence the “chemo” in chemosynthesis. Vent microbes get the energy they need for chemosynthesis by reacting chemical “food” spewed out by vents with oxygen dissolved in the surrounding seawater. It’s a bit like how we get energy to live from reacting our food with the oxygen we breathe. But that oxygen doesn’t come from nowhere. It comes from photosynthesis—photosynthesis that happens in the razor-thin layer of sunlit ocean that sits kilometers of empty, black ocean water above the vent ecosystems it indirectly sustains. So even in the absolute darkness of the deep ocean, the complex ecosystems at hydrothermal vents still fundamentally rely on one of the products of photosynthesis. Of course, there are microbes that can run chemosynthesis without oxygen. Chemicals like sulfate, nitrate, and oxidized iron are decent substitutes and can fill in for oxygen in certain contexts2. But—of course—the reactions that produce these things in any abundance almost always require either oxygen or light (for a different kind of photosynthesis) to proceed. Sulfate, for instance, is one of the best oxygen-alternatives and is abundant in the ocean today but probably only existed in trace quantities before the rise of oxygen. Not so light-independent after all, then.

Turning off photosynthesis and taking O$_2$ completely out of the picture leaves us with just about the worst alternative “breathable” imaginable—CO$_2$. There’s a reason you breath this stuff out and not in. But there are some microbes that make do with CO$_2$ anyways, reacting it with hydrogen gas to yield methane and a little bit (and it is a little bit) of energy. That energy can be used for chemosynthesis, meaning that these “autotrophic methanogens” are actually capable of existing without oxygen (or sulfate, etc.) or organic carbon produced by photosynthesis. So long as the oceans somehow remained liquid, autotrophic methanogens wouldn’t notice if someone turned off the sun. But these guys aren’t the foundation of vent ecosystems. Reacting H$_2$ with CO$_2$ this way barely provides enough energy to be worth doing at all. It just wouldn’t be possible to sustain an amount of biomass comperable to that we see at a black smoker today if autotrophic methanogenesis were the only game in chemosynthesis town. So, turn off photosynthesis and what do we have left at our teeming deep-sea oasis? Not much: autotrophic methanogens at the base of the food chain producing CH$_4$ and organic carbon to build their own cells, other microbes breaking down the dead leftovers of those methanogens into small organic molecules via fermentation, and another kind of methanogen (“hetertrophic”) combining CO$_2$ with those small organic molecules for energy and releasing yet more CH$_4$ in the process. I imagine it’d look more like a slimy patch than an oasis. And if you did expose it to oxygen and light a match nearby, it would probably catch fire pretty easily thanks to all that methane. Fun things to imagine. Anyways, good news—autotrophic methanogenesis is actually a candidate for the “first metabolism” among scientists who think life started at alkaline hydrothermal vents (not black smokers, a different kind)3. So depending on your preferred flavor of origin-of-life hypothesis, all this oxygen doom-and-gloom doesn’t necessarily preclude life on rogue worlds.

If black smokers—the poster-child for light-independent life on Earth—depend on photosynthesis even though they’re leagues (ha-ha ocean words) away from any noteworthy source of light, that begs the question: are there any truly light-independent ecosystems on Earth? Perhaps I should say natural ecosystems. Of course someone could throw some microbes in a box, seal it up, put it in the dark, and say “tah-dah, I’ve done it! A light-independent ecosystem!” But that’s not interesting. We already know that there are limited kinds of carbon fixation that can run without light, oxygen, or a good substitute for oxygen. I’m more interested in whether or not there are any corners of the Earth where those limited forms of carbon fixation are still the foundation of an ecosystem. Usually when we say we’re talking about\"light-independent” ecosystems, we’re really talking about ecosystems that don’t rely on photosynthesis for organic carbon. But as we’ve seen, that isn’t the whole story. Photosynthesis has more than one product. In addition to organic carbon, it produces oxygen—there are also some kinds of photosynthesis that produce substances like elemental sulfur or nitrate that can serve as “oxygen substitutes.” So, when we ask if an ecosystem is “light-independent,” we’re really asking two questions. First, does life in this ecosystem rely on photosynthesis for organic carbon? And does it rely on photosynthesis for something else?

It’s dark in your small intestine (hopefully), but unless you’re eating Riftia worms dredged up fresh from a nearby hydrothermal vent for every meal, the organic carbon in there should all have ultimately derived from photosynthesis. Life in caves usually relies at least a little on organic carbon from the sunny outside, even if chemosynthesis is a major player. Organisms that live in deep sea sediments away from hydrothermal vents also rely on organic carbon that drifts down from the sunlit surface as marine snow. Many of the well-known “anaerobic” or oxygen-free places on Earth can be excluded for the same reason. Sediments and waters in oxygen-poor lakes, deep layers of soil, rice paddies, hypoxic ocean “dead zones,” sewage treatement pants, even some infected wounds are all pretty much oxygen-free and many are dark, but life there relies on organic carbon produced by photosynthesis. They’re not truly “light-independent” Still, there are a few places where life gets by without any photosynthetic organic carbon at all. We’ve already discussed hydrothermal vents. There are also other kinds of undersea geologic systems that support chemosynthetic ecosystems, and even a handful of weird caves where the food chain is entirely based on chemosynthesis. Movile Cave in Romania is one such place—the cave is so isolated that all life there has been cut off from the outside world for over 5 million years. These places support some truly remarkable and odd wildlife, including a host of animals that often looks more like something out of a Star Trek episode than a fellow denizen of planet Earth. Vents support octopus, crabs, fish, shrimp, mussels, and tubeworms a meter long. And in Movile Cave, there are an array of arthropod species and fungi, and even a few leeches (makes me wonder: whose blood are they drinking?). But all those animals should be a red flag. Where there are animals, there is at least some oxygen4. We’ve already been through the oxygen problem for hydrothermal vents. And even though the air in Movile Cave is very low in oxygen, it still contains enough for its animal inhabitants to breathe (but not enough for you).

The microbes that live in seafloor sediments depend in large part on organic carbon that sinks down from the sunlit surface, but underneath that sediment is the real ocean floor: a kind of black volcanic rock called basalt. As water percolates through tiny veins in seafloor basalt, it causes a chemical reaction called serpentinization to occur, slowly generating H$_2$. And since the seawater also contains CO$_2$, serpentinization can provide enough chemical energy for some very lonely autotrophic methanogens to go about their boring business. There are almost certainly a few other places on Earth where similar conditions exist as well, but it is hard to imagine the inhabitants looking all that different. And if you’ll remember, this is pretty much identical to the scenario I outlined earlier for what a rogue planet biosphere might look like. So if you want to see an alien, just go dredge up a rock from the deep sea and whip out a microscope. It’s easy and exciting and to imagine life in the dark, but start thinking about where the organic carbon and especially where the O$_2$ comes from in “dark” ecosystems and it becomes clear very quickly just how revolutionary photosynthesis has been for the Earth. The world as we experience it can only exist because cyanobacteria figured out photosynthesis a few million years ago—and even the places we think of as the most alien and remote have almost all been irreversibly touched by this special metabolism. In that light, it’s remarkable that there is any life at all out there that managed to make it through the oxygen revoultion without noticing, that there truly is a light-independent ecosystem on this planet. Even if it is a pretty boring one. A quick aside—the authors of the paper claiming that ice-covered oceans could exist on rogue planets absolutely nailed the name for their ocean worlds, which I’m honestly a bit disappointed Kurzgesagt didn’t pick up: Steppenwolf planets. Steppenwolf is German for “steppe wolf” and the authors imagine that—and I quote—“any life in this strange habitat would exist like a lone wolf wandering the galactic steppe.” Someone clearly thought he was a poet. Or maybe the authors were just DC comic fans. ↩︎ I purposely avoided getting into the details too much in this post since they’re not necessary to get the main point. But for anyone interested, the difference between good and bad substitutes for oxygen comes down to redox (reduction-oxidation) chemistry. If you’re interested in geobiology or astrobiology, redox chemistry is an important concept to understand because it can be used to predict how much energy is available to life in a given environment. This review from Astrobiology Magazine covers the basics for anyone interested. ↩︎ Again: alkaline vents. NOT black smokers! The vent origin of life people take this veeeerrrry seriously. ↩︎ There is a recently discovered exception to this rule: some tiny, weird animals that live in a briny layer of water at the bottom of the Meditteranean. But as a general rule, animals need oxygen at least some of the time, even if they can get by without it for a while. ↩︎ ","date":"2020-12-19","objectID":"/is-there-a-truly-light-independent-ecosystem/:2:2","tags":["geobiology","photosynthesis","microbial ecology"],"title":"Is there a truly light-independent ecosystem?","uri":"/is-there-a-truly-light-independent-ecosystem/"},{"categories":[],"content":"Update: improved card format available I’ve kept working on my Anki card format and now have a much better template than the one I use in this deck.

Check out the template, or read my post about conditional formatting in Anki based on field contents. You can find those posts on my language blog, Monoglot Anxiety. I decided it was best to separate my language hobby from my personal homepage, so all future German/Anki posts will be there. After finishing Duolingo German, I started making digital flashcards so that I’d have something to keep my iThumbs occupied through corona lockdown better than scrolling through the reams of international and domestic horrors served up by my newsfeed. I ended up spending months of experimenting with Anki and looking into popular German vocabulary sets online, and this 1000-word flashcard deck of core German vocabulary is the result. I put a lot of thought into my deck and drew a lot from my experience learning German to inform what words to include and how to build the cards. For instance, every word in my deck is taught along with its important grammatical properties such as gender and plural for nouns and conjugations for verbs. Noun articles are even automatically color-coded by gender using a bit of JavaScript and CSS.
