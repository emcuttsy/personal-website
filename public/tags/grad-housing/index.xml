    <description><![CDATA[MIT recently asked on-campus residents to re-sign their license agreement because of changes to housing policy related to the pandemic. And after reading the fine print, I am seriously considering not re-signing. Even though I got my first choice for on-campus housing, I plan to try and move off-campus if I can.
