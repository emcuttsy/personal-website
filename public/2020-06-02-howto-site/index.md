# How I Made This Site



I originally used  a popular all-in-one web service. But after 3 years of drag-and-drop, this site is now based powered by Hugo. Making my peace with needing a *bit* of code earned me a new website that is faster, more beautiful and much, *much* cheaper.

Of course, there's no one right way to make a website. This setup just happens to work well for me. I just hope that sharing my experience---both with a popular web design service and with my current, Markdown-based setup---might go a little way towards making this whole website business a bit less brain-dribbling-out-the-ear for you.

## Breaking up with WYSIWYG 
I'm not a web developer, and I would describe my experience with programming as minimal. So when I decided to make a personal website, I originally registered my domain with [Wix](www.wix.com) and used their WYSIWYG website editor to build and maintain my site for years. 

**WYSIWYG** stands for "What You See Is What You Get," and it essentially means what it says. A WYSIWYG editor shows the designer what the final product will look like, not a pile of code that then later gets rendered into a final product.
