      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been about six months now since I shot off my first pitch to Science News, and by all accounts it&amp;rsquo;s been going pretty well since then.
I&amp;rsquo;ve since written for a few dream publications including Scientific American, pitched my first feature (fingers crossed), and finally mustered the courage to quit my PhD. Yup, it&amp;rsquo;s official: I&amp;rsquo;m now a Masters student and am slated to graduate in May 2022.
Writing has been going well, or at least well enough for me to leave MIT on the bet that a career in science journalism will work out.</description>

      <description>I suspect that there are plenty of other researchers out there who are at least toying with the idea that writing about science might be more fun than actually doing it. But how to start?
Breaking into science writing without media experience is intimidating, but it is possible. My first reported science story ran this week in Science News, and seeing as the obligatory rounds of self-promotional texts have been sent and the celebratory tea poured, now feels like a good time to pause and reflect.</description>
