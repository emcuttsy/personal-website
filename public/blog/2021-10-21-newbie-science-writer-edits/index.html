<p>Yes, I committed the cardinal sin of journalism. To be fair, I made this mistake on my very first story—my piece on roadside ditches purifying water—and</p>

<p>After joining, I signed up for the Perlman Virtual Mentorship Program, a summer mentor-match program for student NASW members. I was paired with an amazing freelance science journalist who covers Earth and space science and bit of biology, and I started to work on a reporting project for the program that should run on the NASW Student Newsroom site in August. With my mentor&rsquo;s help, I also started to put together pitches for <em>Science News</em> and <em>Eos</em>.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t understate how important finding a mentor was for me. Being able to ask my mentor questions was especially helpful for learning the subtler things in science journalism &mdash; like how to email editors and sources, what pitches look like, how old research can be before it&rsquo;s not fresh anymore, where to look for interesting science stories, how much pay is reasonable, what publications like what kinds of stories, etc. etc. She read my emails to help me feel less scared the first time I sent them off, and she helped me revise stories once I got assignments.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s any chance you can find a mentor, take it. Join whatver programs you can to get one. Just get one. It&rsquo;ll make all the difference.</p>

<p>My mentor told me that a good way to find a science story is to pick a few journals (preferably obscure ones, staffers and pro freelancers will beat you to anything from <em>Science</em> or <em>Nature</em>) to follow and look for interesting papers as they came out. I did just that, and found a few papers I liked. I picked one to write about for the Perlman program project, and one to pitch directly to publications.</p>
<p>I wrote a pitch by basically copying what I saw on 
<a href="https://www.theopennotebook.com/pitch-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TON&rsquo;s Pitch Database</a>. I originally sent the pitch to an editor at <em>Eos</em>, but it was rejected. So my mentor suggested I send the pitch to <em>Science News</em> and she found an editor contact for me by asking around among her colleagues (trading editor contacts is apparently normal practice among journalists).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally best if you email an editor directly. Find a specific person to email. Even if you email the wrong person (which I actually did end up doing with <em>Science News</em>!), editors can pass your emails along to the person who should really see them.</p>
<p>I sent off the pitch and, to my great shock and joy, <em>Science News</em> actually took it!</p>
<p>The boring but important stuff: they offered me a rate I was happy with and a contract that wasn&rsquo;t exploitative, so I officially signed on to write the story. $650 for 500 words is better than I was expecting to start with, and my mentor says not to go below $0.75/word as a general rule. <u><em>Even as a new freelancer, you shouldn&rsquo;t take exploitatively low pay or sign a ridiculous contract</em></u>. Negotiate with editors if something&rsquo;s off &mdash; I negotiated my second contract, and while I didn&rsquo;t get what I asked for, I didn&rsquo;t lose any standing with my editor, either. It&rsquo;s just business. If you&rsquo;re curious about the financial side of freelancing and what to look out for in contracts, I can&rsquo;t recommend Wudan Yan and Jenni Gritters' freelance business podcast,
<a href="https://www.thewriterscooppod.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Writers Co-op</a>, enough.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that!</p>

<p>Whew. That&rsquo;s probably more detail than anyone wanted or needed. But the point is to be transparent.</p>
<p>I hope you got the sense that there wasn&rsquo;t any master plan here. There wasn&rsquo;t. Getting a mentor was the most important part for me, and I&rsquo;d recommend finding someone to mentor you if you can. But if not, there&rsquo;s no magic to it. My editor at <em>Science News</em> didn&rsquo;t know my mentor &mdash; she took my pitch based on what it said and the little portfolio I had, not because of backroom handshaking. If you build up a portfolio and write a good pitch (there&rsquo;s a whole 
<a href="https://www.theopennotebook.com/pitch-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database</a> of examples), you can get published.</p>
<p>You might get rejected, and that&rsquo;s fine. Pitch the story again somewhere else. I only pitched <em>Science News</em> after <em>Eos</em> rejected my first pitch. And pitch again to editors who don&rsquo;t take your first pitch &mdash; <em>Eos</em> took me the second time around.</p>
