# English tutoring and proofreading for university, academia, and STEM


<br>

In addition to my full-time "job" as a PhD student, I offer **online English lessons and writing coaching** and an **"academic English proofreading service** for ESL with a special focus on the needs of people learning English for science, technology, or engineering. 

<u>**I am currently taking new students**</u> and would love to hear from you! 

Please email me at me@elisecutts.com with any questions, or book a free 15-minute trial lesson if you'd like to meet me "in person" via video chat.

For proofreading inquiries, please simply email me.
