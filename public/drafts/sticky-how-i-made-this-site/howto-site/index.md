# How to make this website


After 3 years of dragging-and-dropping with [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), this site is now powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Making my peace with needing a *bit* of code earned me a website I'm much happier with and that costs a lot less to maintain.

This page outlines the tools and services that I used to create this site. I also go through my experience and reasons for moving my site away from an all-in-one website builder.

While I'm sure that I didn't do everything perfectly (or even well) I still hope you'll find this resource helpful.

## Introduction: Where I started

When I decided to make a personal website, I had no clue how web design and hosting worked beyond a splash of exposure to HTML and CSS as a kid. So


Not knowing better, I made an account with Wix, a popular WYSIWYG web design and hosting service. I paid for a premium plan, registered my domain, and started building my site with their drag-and-drop editor. 

### All-in-one and WYSIWYG

WYSIWYG (pronounced "wiz-ee-wig") stands for What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get. It  basically means what it says: a WYSIWG editor shows you something very much like the end product you can expect to build using it.

Using a WYSIWYG editor for your website spares you from having to deal with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and everything else that makes a website tick. You can build a site by simply dragging and dropping graphic elements, text, and widgets around while the editor builds the code underneath. 

The main advantage of using a WYSIWYG editor is ease of use. And services like Wix and Squarespace make things even easier.

These all-in-one services provide not only WYSIWYG design, but also everything else required for launching and running a site. This means that you don't have to worry about things like registering or transferring a domain, setting up email boxes, analytics, cloud services, etc. It's all done for you. 

All that ease of use comes at a literal price. A basic plan with an all-in-one service will often run you over $100 a year. 

### Why I left Wix

That's a fair price, considering how powerful all-in-one services are these days. They often offer lots of useful tools for businesses and brands that would be very difficult to put together yourself. But if your site only uses a fraction of the functionality---say, a simple homepage with a blog---it is likely overkill.

Additionally, the simplicity of WYSIWYG can come with limitations. Wix, for instance, doesn't allow you to add your own HTML files to your site. You can only build pages within their editor.
