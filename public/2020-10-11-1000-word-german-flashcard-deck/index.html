            Update: improved card format available
        
        
            I&rsquo;ve kept working on my Anki card format and now have a much better template than the one I use in this deck.
My new template automatically generates cloze deletions based on example sentences (no need to make separate notes for clozes or make &ldquo;fake&rdquo; clozes on basic cards by hand) and color-codes nouns by gender using conditional formatting.
Check out the template, or read my post about conditional formatting in Anki based on field contents.
You can find those posts on my language blog, Monoglot Anxiety. I decided it was best to separate my language hobby from my personal homepage, so all future German/Anki posts will be there.

        
    
After finishing Duolingo German, I started making digital flashcards so that I&rsquo;d have something to keep my iThumbs occupied through corona lockdown better than scrolling through the reams of international and domestic horrors served up by my newsfeed. I ended up spending months of experimenting with Anki and looking into popular German vocabulary sets online, and this 1000-word flashcard deck of core German vocabulary  is the result." />

<p>I put a lot of thought into my deck and drew a lot from my experience learning German to inform what words to include and how to build the cards.</p>
<p>For instance, every word in my deck is taught along with its important grammatical properties such as gender and plural for nouns and conjugations for verbs.  Noun articles are even automatically color-coded by gender using a bit of JavaScript and CSS. And the cards attempt to strike a nice balance between hitting critical basic vocabulary (der Mann, sprechen, blau, etc.) and not wasting time with words like articles and pronouns that are really best left to grammar lessons and immersion.</p>

<p>Nouns are important, but I tend to think that they overshadow other parts of speech (especially verbs) in vocabulary lists for learners in a way that hinders expression and fluency.

<h2 id="my-deck-is-available-for-anyone-to-use-for-free-on-anki">My deck is available for anyone to use for free on Anki</h2>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Anki</a> is a free, open-source digital flashcard program mostly known for its use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">spaced repetition method</a>.</p>
<p>Spaced repetition has been shown to improve memory retention under some circumstances, and based on my experience digging around on Anki enthusiast forums and blogs, it seems that Anki&rsquo;s core (or at least most vocal) demographic is a combination of med students and quiz bowl types, a crowd united in its need to absorb and retain heaps of minutea.</p>
<p>Language learners also need to absorb and retain heaps of minutea, and there are plenty of spaced repetition softwares out there made specificaly with language learners in mind. The famous Pimsleur Language Programs are based on spaced repetition, as are Memrise, Quizlet, and Wanikan</p>
<p>Anki isn&rsquo;t specifically targeted at anyone, and comes with a lot of customizability and control that allow users to shape their own experiences and tailor the app to their own needs. It is also media-rich, allowing images, embedded audio, and even video and GIFs. If you know a bit of HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript, you can take card customization pretty far and implement things like conditional formatting based on the content of your cards, which is something I&rsquo;ll post about later.</p>
<p>The main reason I like Anki is that it <strong>allows me to make my own cards and sync them across my devices for free</strong>—which is something anyone can enjoy even if you&rsquo;re not interested in getting into the Anki-optimization weeds.</p>

<p>These cards are still a work in progress, and I&rsquo;ll be updating the Google Drive spreadsheet and Anki deck as I make corrections and fix errors/bugs. I&rsquo;m also working to neaten the HTML/CSS and JavaScript that controls conditional formatting on the noun cards and am looking into conditional formatting for irregular verbs as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently also playing around with the idea of making &ldquo;expansion packs&rdquo; of vocabulary built around certain themes (food, high fantasy, politics, etc.) that work with my card formats. If that ends up happnening I will of course also make the Google Sheets available as well for anyone who prefers to make their own cards.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out if you notice an error in the cards or want to help with improving them. I hope they&rsquo;re useful!</p></div><div class="post-footer" id="post-footer">
